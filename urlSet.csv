By Alma Fausto | afausto@scng.com | Orange County RegisterPUBLISHED: December 1, 2017 at 9:43 a.m. | UPDATED: December 1, 2017 at 8:05 p.m.FULLERTON – Three people – including a Laguna Beach policeman – were arrested this week on suspicion of defrauding two older relatives out of hundreds of thousands of dollars, police said on Friday.
The officer is 58-year-old Rock Wagner of Lake Forest. The other two suspects are his sister, Wendy Wagner, 55, and her boyfriend, Norman McBride, 58, both of Huntington Beach.

All three were arrested on suspicion of elder abuse and fraud.
Though Fullerton police would give few details about the case, they did reveal that the investigation began in June when they were told about the alleged misconduct by the Orange County District Attorney’s Office and Orange County Adult Protective Services.


Sgt. Jon Radus, Fullerton P.D.’s spokesman, said that agency took the lead on the investigation because a financial institution involved in the case is based out of that city.
Radus said that the victims, a man and woman, are relatives of the officer and his sister. The three suspects were arrested on Tuesday, Nov. 28.
The trio were booked into the Fullerton City Jail. They have since posted bail and been released. A representative with the District Attorney’s Office said no charges have been filed yet and declined to further discuss the case.
Wagner, a nine-year veteran of the Laguna Beach Police Department, is on paid administrative leave until an internal-affairs investigation is over, Chief Laura Farinella told the Register.
Farinella said the department was told about the impending arrest so they could be present and confiscate his badge and gun.


“It’s very disappointing,” she said. “No police officer is above the law. We’re held to a higher standard.”

PressNEWARK — ""The Situation"" has a situation.Michael Sorrentino, known as ""The Situation"" and a star of the MTV reality television hit ""Jersey Shore,"" and his brother Marc Sorrentino pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday to tax and conspiracy charges that could land them in jail for years.The pair have been indicted on charges of not properly paying taxes on $8.9 million in income from Michael Sorrentino's promotional activities.The Sorrentinos pleaded not guilty to all charges during a 7½-minute hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven C. Mannion in U.S. District Court. The brothers each were released on a $250,000 unsecured bond.The Situation exited the courthouse with his lawyer, Richard Sapinski of Newark. Michael did not answer questions, but said ""Thanks, guys"" to reporters and cameramen, including a crew from TMZ, before he and his lawyer got into a silver-colored Kia with New York plates in a nearby parking lot.Someone from the media scrum — attempting to get The Situation to comment — said ""what's your tax situation, Mike?"" Another said that it was ""most impressive"" the Situation had made $9 million from ""Jersey Shore,"" the MTV reality show that ran from 2009-12 and showcased the antics of Sorrentino and five other 20-somethings who summered at a beach house in Seaside Heights.Marc Sorrentino exited the courthouse with his attorney, Chris Adams of Colts Neck, and also said nothing audible to reporters and cameramen.The Sorrentinos surrendered to U.S. marshals and IRS special agents on Wednesday to appear in federal court.Michael and Marc Sorrentino are charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Marc and Michael Sorrentino also are charged with three and two counts, respectively, of filing false tax returns for 2010 through 2012. Michael Sorrentino faces an additional count for allegedly failing to file a tax return for 2011, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.The conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The filing false tax return counts each carry a maximum potential penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The count charging Michael Sorrentino with failing to file a tax return carries a maximum potential penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine, according to the office.Authorities said the brothers fraudulently claimed millions of dollars in personal expenses as business expenses. Those expenses included payments for high-end vehicles and clothing, personal grooming and direct payments from the businesses to personal bank accounts, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.This income was largely received by two companies controlled by the brothers, MPS Entertainment and Situation Nation, authorities said.""Rather than living in reality and reporting their true income, Michael Sorrentino and his brother Marc created the illusion that they earned less income by filing false and fraudulent tax returns,"" said Jonathan D. Larsen, acting special agent in charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, Newark Field Office.According to the indictment, aside from television and personal appearances, the brothers drew income from a vodka company, ownership of an online clothing business, publication of an autobiography and a comic book featuring Michael Sorrentino as a superhero. Income was also derived by both men from Michael Sorrentino's endorsements of vitamins, DVDs, clothing lines, jewelry, tuxedos and sunglasses, according to the indictment.Both men also entered into contracts with booking agencies for Michael Sorrentino to make personal appearances at various venues, including nightclubs, bars and liquor stores, in exchange for booking fees from $1,500 to $48,000 per appearance, according to the indictment. Much of that money was paid in cash, according to the indictment.The men are accused of failing to report the cash received: $184,000 in 2010, $154,000 in 2011 and $311,000 in 2012.The indictment is not Michael Sorrentino's first brush with the law.Michael Sorrentino was in Middletown Municipal Court appearing on an assault charge at the end of July.Middletown municipal court judge Richard Thompson adjourned the case for 12 weeks while Sorrentino was set to undergo anger management therapy.Sorrentino was joined in the Middletown courtroom by his family, including his brother, Frank, who he was accused of assaulting.The municipal charges against Sorrentino could be amended to a municipal offense, which would be equivalent to a noise complaint, and less than the disorderly persons offense he faces, if the counseling program is successfully completed, said Edward Fradkin of Freehold, Sorrentino's attorney on the municipal charge.In 2010, Marc Sorrentino was accused by Kathryn Redino of New York City of hitting her in the stomach with his forearm as he exited a limousine outside his Dorado Beach Court home. Patrolman Robert Hill, the responding officer, declined to file any charges because he saw no evidence of assault. Redino then signed a complaint herself against Marc Sorrentino on Oct. 22 that accused him of simple assault. Sorrentino responded with a complaint of his own against Redino, this one accusing her of providing false information to a law enforcement authority.The following March, the two agreed in Municipal Court to drop the complaints against each other.Michael and Marc Sorrentino are scheduled to be arraigned on the federal indictment before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton in Newark federal court on Oct. 6.Both brothers are starring in a family-based reality show called ""The Sorrentinos"" on the TV Guide Network, which also stars brother Frank, sister Melissa and mom Linda Sorrentino.About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Reviewed Jobs Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall Storytellers© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."

Madoff, who helped carry out one of the biggest frauds in Wall Street history, died on Thursday. He was 58.The cause was lung cancer, said his lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey, who declined to say where Mr. DiPascali had died.Mr. DiPascali had been out on bail, awaiting a sentencing hearing in September. After pleading guilty in 2009 to 10 felony counts, including conspiracy and tax evasion, Mr. DiPascali faced a prison term of up to 125 years, a sentence he hoped to have significantly reduced because of his extensive cooperation with federal prosecutors. In a letter to the court in 2010, prosecutors said Mr. DiPascali had “already provided substantial assistance to the government in its investigation.”Mr. DiPascali, Mr. Mukasey said in a brief statement on Sunday, had been “grateful to have been able to make some amends by helping the government these past few years.”In his court testimony in August 2009, when he pleaded guilty, Mr. DiPascali described himself as a “kid from Queens” who landed a job with a rising young financial whiz, Mr. Madoff. That opportunity came by way of a neighbor. He grew up next door to Mr. Madoff’s personal secretary, Annette Bongiorno. She provided the introduction, and Mr. DiPascali joined Mr. Madoff’s firm in 1975, after he graduated from Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens.Mr. DiPascali rose steadily in the firm to eventually become its chief financial officer. Along the way, he became close to Mr. Madoff, whom Mr. DiPascali described as “a mentor to me and a lot more.” His allegiance to his mentor, he suggested, led him astray. “I was loyal to him,” Mr. DiPascali said. “I ended up being loyal to a terrible, terrible fault.”In his court testimony, he said that for at least 20 years he had helped Mr. Madoff carry out a vast financial fraud that prosecutors estimated at $65 billion, including the fictitious profits claimed over the years. The Ponzi scheme, Mr. DiPascali testified, involved using historical stock data from the Internet to create fake trade records and sending bogus account statements, among other tactics.“I knew it was criminal, and I did it anyway,” Mr. DiPascali told the court.That day, he also expressed his remorse. “I apologize to every victim of this catastrophe and to my family and to the government,” Mr. DiPascali said. “I am very, very sorry.” As part of a bail agreement in 2010, Mr. DiPascali and his family agreed to give up nearly all of their assets, worth millions, including their house in Bridgewater, N.J. His wife, Joanne, was allowed to keep $178,000. Mr. DiPascali, according to court testimony, had four children — Gregory, Frank, Michael and Dorothy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions

News San Jose Pot Club Accused of Fraud, Money Laundering
By Jennifer Wadsworth @jennwadsworth / February 4, 2016 6

A criminal grand jury indicted owners of a San Jose pot club on felony charges of illegal marijuana sales, worker’s compensation fraud, tax fraud, insurance fraud and money laundering.
Authorities allege San Jose Organics failed to pay $2 million in taxes despite a paper trail showing that the collective made $10 million in profit from 2013 to 2015. Police say they also found $800,000 in cash at owner Ben Lew’s San Francisco home and another $400,000 at other places connected to the investigation.
Lew, 44, faces a maximum of 46 years in prison if found guilty of 46 felonies and one misdemeanor. His manager, 43-year-old Brian Wong, faces up to 23 years if sentenced for 15 felonies and a misdemeanor. The dispensary’s secretary of corporation, 28-year-old Ernest Ma, could spend up to a decade in prison if convicted of six felonies.
“People like these defendants are profiteers exploiting the medical marijuana laws,” Santa Clara County prosecutor Edward Liang said. “They do this, while at the same time ignoring laws that every other business in California is required to follow. We would not accept this conduct in any other industry. We will continue to hold medical marijuana dispensaries to the same standards.”
Lew’s attorney, San Francisco-based Russell Goodrow, declined to comment on the case for the time being; as did Wong’s counsel, J. David Nick. The suspects aren’t expected to enter pleas in the case for another two weeks, Nick said.
Police raided San Jose Organics, which operated a storefront off of Tully Road, in July of last year. According to Liang, evidence showed that the collective raked in about $25,000 a day in sales.
San Jose Organics was the subject of a NBC Bay Area investigation in May 2015. Reporters equipped with hidden cameras reportedly caught the club selling to patients younger than 21. While state law allows clubs to dispense marijuana to patients over 18, San Jose has set the legal age at 21.
The city tried to shutter the club for nearly a year and fined its operators $100,000 at the time of the report. Two months later, state and local law enforcement raided the club and arrested its owners.

Robert T. Koger of Molinaro Koger is arrested and put behind bars. A shocking course of continuing fraudulent conduct is unveiled.

By Jim Butler and the Global Hospitality Group®






 


11 September 2013
Hotel Lawyer with the latest on the arrest and jailing of Rob Koger, formerly of Molinaro Koger
There are some significant new developments in the saga of Robert T. (“Rob”) Koger and the high profile civil and criminal cases surrounding him. Here is the latest. (Earlier articles are cited below.)
On Monday, September 9, 2013, Robert T. Koger, 47, was arrested and brought before a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia. At the detention hearing, a court determines whether an accused will be released from jail (on bail or otherwise) before the trial. In Koger’s case the court found that Koger is a “flight risk” and he will therefore be held behind bars where he will stay until his trial for mail fraud and other criminal charges.
Background on the case
Koger was one of the principals in the Virginia-based hotel brokerage firm of Molinaro Koger, Inc., until the publicity of Koger’s fraud and deceptions of client Host Hotels & Resorts led to the demise of his firm.
Earlier this year, on February 19, 2013, the US Attorneys’ office announced that the COO of Molinaro Koger (Jonathan Propp) had pled guilty in federal court to conspiracy to commit wire fraud as part of a 3-year, $20 million “straw buyer” scheme involving the sale of hotels for the account of Host Hotels & Resorts.
It was only a matter of time until action was taken against Koger, and now the public process has started with the arrest and incarceration of Koger.
What happened at Monday’s hearing?

In an article dated September 11, 2013 (Broker Arrested Over $2.5 M Real Estate Fraud), Kathryn Brenzel, writing for Law 360 reported on Koger’s arrest and detention hearing. She noted that Koger is facing multiple [civil] lawsuits related to real estate fraud.
Remarkably, the affidavits cited in the report by Law360 say that Koger did not stop his fraudulent schemes when Host charged him with fraud. Instead, even during the pending criminal investigation, the report says that Koger continued his fraudulent activities through July and August, 2013. In fact, the federal authorities worked with one of the last victims to document part of the charges leading to his arrest.
According to an affidavit filed in connection with Monday’s hearing:
“The methods and means that Koger used to execute the Tampa frauds are consistent with the long-term pattern of criminal tradecraft Koger has used to execute multiple other similar fraud schemes.”
“Significantly, Koger has continued his pattern of activity while he knew he was under investigation and in an ostensible attempt to impede that investigation.”
Authorities estimate that Koger’s fraudulent schemes garnered more than $50 million.
The case is USA v. Koger, case number 1:13-mj-00542, in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
Why is this case significant?
The case of USA v. Koger is significant because it is a criminal case. It involves big names in the hotel industry — a significant hotel brokerage firm, the largest lodging REIT in the country and other well-known industry players in the roles of good guys and bad guys. This kind of problem is certainly not the norm of hotel brokerage, nor even very common.
But the acts complained of here are flagrant and outrageous. The brokerage firm used straw buyers to defraud sellers into selling properties at one price and then quickly flipped such properties to other buyers for an instant profit. The brokers forged a dead straw buyer’s signature. Brokers took funds that were to be placed in escrow accounts and paid salaries and operating expenses with them.
And according to an affidavit in the current case, Rob Koger, practically up to the date of his arrest, was using false identities (posing as “Rick Thompson” and “John Stern” among others), a slew of bogus email accounts and trying to steal millions of dollars through his chicanery.
In addition to the extreme conduct, it appears that the fraudulent schemes were BIG in scope — perpetrated over 5 or more years, and involved up to $50 million stolen by Koger and his accomplices.
What was Koger thinking?

'Alaskan Bush People' stars plead guilty in fraud caseBy Michael Pearson, CNNUpdated 1450 GMT (2250 HKT) January 12, 2016 The Brown family, from left: Snowbird, Solomon, Gabe, Billy, Ami, Noah, Matt, Joshua ""Bam Bam"" and Rain.Story highlights In a statement, Billy Brown blames the issues on poor-record keepingThe deal calls for dropping charges against other family members, newspaper says (CNN)According to the Discovery Channel's description for the reality show ""Alaskan Bush People,"" the featured family lives life ""so far removed from civilization that they often go six to nine months of the year without seeing an outsider.""That wasn't always the case, apparently.On Monday, the Brown family patriarch and one of his sons pleaded guilty to fraud charges involving allegations that they took money from a state fund for residents while they were living elsewhere, according to media reports.Billy Brown, 63, and Joshua Brown, 31, were sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor charge of unsworn falsification in the second degree, according to the Juneau Empire newspaper.They'll also have to pay fines and thousands of dollars in restitution, the newspaper said.Read MoreBilly Brown and his son reportedly attended the hearing by telephone from California.The elder Brown had originally been charged with 24 counts, including several felony charges, according to court records. His son faced six counts.Four other members of the family were also charged. The plea deal with Billy Brown and his son calls for those charges to be dismissed, the newspaper reported.The pleas stem from allegations that family members had bilked the state's Permanent Fund out of more than $20,000 by claiming in applications from 2009 to 2012 that they met residency requirements when they hadn't, according to the Juneau Empire.The  fund, which is derived from oil revenues, requires residents to live in the state year-round to receive payouts.The program allows absences of up to 180 days, or even longer for one of 16 specific reasons, such as military service, education or long-term health care needs.According to the Juneau Empire, Brown and his son signed statements as part of the court case saying they'd left Alaska in 2009 and did not return until 2012 -- two years before the Discovery Channel show began airing.In a statement, Billy Brown blamed the problem on poor record-keeping.""Because of the way we live our lives and the way we often unconventionally travel, I didn't keep good track of our movements,"" Brown said. ""I accept full responsibility for filing for benefits without confirming that we met the requirements.""We are committed to living in Alaska for the long term and we respect the state's rules,"" said Brown, who also apologized to the judge on Monday.""I thought it best to settle to put this behind us.""The allegations involve claims predating the Discovery Channel show, which began airing in 2014. It's unclear what, if any, impact the pleas could have on the show, which is currently in reruns.A spokeswoman for the channel said Discovery had no comment on the case.

View CommentsMichael David ScottJOHN TLUMACKI/GLOBE STAFFMichael David Scott, a 51-year-old former Mansfield real estate broker, has pleaded guilty to fraud in a years-long mortgage fraud scheme that resulted in foreclosures of dozens of Boston properties and left some of its many victims with crippling debt and ruined credit.Scott was the subject of a lengthy investigative piece by The Boston Globe in 2009 that detailed how he misled property investors into buying condos he owned in Roxbury and Dorchester, and failed to both fix up the properties and pay their mortgages as he had promised.Documents filed by prosecutors in US Federal Court in Boston said Scott had pleaded guilty to duping “the buyers of nearly 180 condominiums into fraud with disastrous results to their finances and long term damage to their credit, all for Scott’s own personal benefit.”AdvertisementFirst charged in 2010, Scott pleaded guilty in late May to 57 counts of wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August. Prosecutors said guidelines for the charges indicate that Scott could face more than 22 years in prison. He is also awaiting a second trial, scheduled to begin later this year, on additional fraud charges resulting from real estate deals.Two attorneys for Scott did not respond to requests for comment.Stuart Schrier, a Dorchester real estate lawyer who once represented one of Scott’s creditors, said the real estate developer was a destructive force.“He destroyed the neighborhood,” Schrier said. “He could afford to overpay because he was flipping them for so much, so he drove up the prices and pushed honest buyers out of the market.”Schrier said the fraud even ate into his own business closing real estate transactions because many were ultimately tied to Scott.“Every time I was about to do a deal, I would find out it was another one of his crazy deals with fake deposits, so I’d have to decline to close it,” Schrier said. “I made no money for years.”AdvertisementAccording to a release from the office of US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz and the 2009 Globe story, Scott bought up dozens of multifamily residences in Roxbury and Dorchester in the mid-2000s, then quickly sold off individual units inside each house as condos, earning more than he had paid for the home as a whole.He would then induce the condo buyers to take out mortgages and allegedly fudged the paperwork to make it seem as if the buyers had higher incomes and had made substantial down payments. Scott told the buyers they would not be responsible for the loan payments, and promised to fix up the rundown units and sell them at a profit for the buyers.Scott employed two out-of-state accomplices to help recruit the condo buyers, who in many cases lived outside Massachusetts.When the real estate market collapsed in 2008, Scott allegedly stopped making payments on many of the mortgages. The resulting forecloses of those properties destroyed the finances and credit ratings of many buyers.For a time after the 2010 indictment, Scott continued to be involved in real estate deals while the charges were pending. He later surrendered his license to the state Division of Professional Licensure.Court records show that Scott has been jailed since March 25, 2014, when he was arrested again for fraud in a separate case. Federal prosecutors in that case said that even after giving up his license in 2012, Scott continued to defraud a number of real estate investors, allegedly netting $694,000.AdvertisementIf convicted of the new charges, prosecutors said, Scott could face a sentence of at least 17 years and 6 months.Scott’s lawyers asked in a federal court motion this month that he be released before his Aug. 26 sentencing for the 2010 indictments, saying he needed time to “get his affairs in order.” The motion noted that Scott, who is from Trinidad and Tobago, but has been a US citizen since 1992, has already surrendered his US and Trinidadian passports. Scott’s lawyers even offered to put up his Mansfield home and his aunt’s condominium as a guarantee that he will not flee.Prosecutors, on the other hand, said Scott is a significant flight risk and “an economic danger to the community.”Lawyers for both sides noted that Scott served as the treasurer of First Baptist Church in Mansfield for more than a decade, and that the church’s pastor has appeared in court to support Scott — but prosectors said the charges in his second trial include allegations that Scott defrauded the Church of God House of Deliverance in Dorchester of $69,000.The others whom prosecutors said helped Scott in his scheme, Jerrold Fowler, 31, and Thursa Raetz, 40, both of Norfolk Va., each pleaded guilty to counts of wire fraud, prosecutors said.AdvertisementDan Adams can be reached at dadams@globe.com.

A Laredo businessman for the past 20 years paid employees at San Antonio auto title companies to push through fraudulent vehicle registration applications, according to a search warrant affidavit.
Investigators with the Webb County Tax Assessor-Collector's Office, Webb County Sheriff's Offiice and the Texas Department of Public Safety served search warrants Thursday morning at the Laredo home and business of Roberto Resendez, 58.


Resendez is not charged with a crime, but investigators allege in an affidavit that he paid employees inside San Antonio auto title companies to register vehicles for Webb County residents.





 
Webb County Tax Assessor-Collector Patricia Barrera said she could give details of the case, but “it has to do with motor vehicles and what we believe is illegal registration taking place in San Antonio when it should be done in Laredo. We believe that monies that should have been going to the state and Webb County have not reached us.”
Resendez could not be reached for comment Thursday.
When Texas residents make a private auto purchase, it's up to them to pay a 6.25 percent sales tax to their county tax assessor, according to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles.

In Bexar County, private companies have contracts with the tax assessor-collector to process title applications.
Investigators said Resendez would take his customers' money and submit to his contacts in San Antonio fraudulent paperwork that reported a reduced sale price, “which resulted in loss of tax revenue for the state of Texas.”
One of Resendez's employees told investigators he would give title applications and envelopes of cash to an employee of San Antonio Auto Title Services.
The owners of San Antonio Auto Title could not be reached for comment Thursday.
When his contact there got fired, Resendez started using an employee at River City Auto Title, according to the affidavit.
River City Auto Title owner Tom Menchaca said he had not been contacted by law enforcement officials and said his company hasn't done anything wrong.

Even if fraudulent applications were to somehow make it through the screening process at the title company, Menchaca said, they should have been caught at the tax assessor-collector's office.
“When we turn the paperwork in to the county, they check it,” he said. “They check our work before they send it off to Austin, and if there's anything that looks crossways, they reject it. If there's anything that we were doing wrong, they would catch it.”
David DeLeon, Bexar County's director of motor vehicle registration, said tax assessor-collector employees randomly check title applications, but can't go through all the applications that come in from title companies before forwarding them to the state.

Under the previous administration, the office's chief investigator had been in contact with Webb County about a fraud investigation, DeLeon said, but the investigator has since left and he doesn't know what came of it.
“If this office finds out about any kind of illegal activity that's going on, we will act quickly and decisively,” said Bexar County Tax Assessor-collector Albert Uresti.

TRENTON, N.J. (CBSNewYork) – A Jersey City man has been arrested for allegedly racking up a high bill with a credit card that was fraudulently obtained, state authorities announced Monday.
Lasean Harps, 37, was arrested on Friday on charges of second-degree theft by deception, second-degree impersonation and theft of identity, and third-degree fraudulent use of a credit card, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa announced.
Harps is accused of making $85,000 worth of unauthorized purchases since September, authorities said.
“Mr. Harps allegedly racked up tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise on what he believed would be someone else’s dime,” said Chiesa. “The charges brought today by the Division of Criminal Justice are the first step in making sure that this defendant is brought to justice and held accountable for his alleged crime.”
Prosecutors said Harps used the fraudulently obtained Chase Visa card at dozens of locations across the state.
Chiesa also said that Harps’ girlfriend Courtney Wilson, 31, also of Jersey City, has been charged for allegedly hindering the investigation into the case.
Harps, who authorities said also went by the aliases Antoine Taylor, Mark Mobley, Sean Harps, Sean Carter and Sean Harris, could face up to a decade in state prison for each second-degree crime and a hefty fine if convicted.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL)--Two Tallahassee business owners are out on bond tonight after being arrested for tax fraud. They're accused of collecting sales tax from customers and not turning the money in to the state.
""Angelettes? Yea I eat here probably every couple weeks if their open,"" said John Daily
Daily frequents Angelette's restaurant located on the 3500 block of Blair Stone Road in Tallahassee.
But Daily says the restaurant is always packed with people. He added he was unaware Marlo Angelette, the owner of the restaurant was arrested.
""Yea it was kind of shocking that the business owner doesn't pay taxes or didn't pay taxes,"" said Daily.
Angelette is now facing felony and misdemeanor charges for stealing state funds, failure to file tax returns, and not paying taxes.
There's a sign hanging outside of the door of Angelette's that read ""cash and check only."" Customers tell WTXL, the restaurant owner changed the policy changed only a few months ago.
""You know, why don't they accept credit cards? It doesn't make sense if everyone uses them, it doesn't make any sense that no one would accept them,"" said Daily.
The Department of Revenue says Angelette owes the state more than $16,000 dollars.
We tried reaching out to Angelette but we were told she was unavailable to comment.
Meanwhile, the Lofty Pursuits and Infinite Illusions hobby store owner Greg Cohen was also arrested on the same charges. The state says he now owes more than $30,000 dollars.
We spoke with him over the phone, he says he's been instructed by his lawyer not to comment at this time
The DOR says each of the owners collected sales tax from their customers at their businesses but never paid it back to the state.
""Its kind of disappointing to be honest with you.we all pay taxes, I pay taxes, probably a lot more than we probably want to but its disappointing when a business owner doesn't do that contribute their fair share,"" said Daily.
While the doors still remain open for both businesses,if the owners are convicted, they could be facing some jail time.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonThe scandal was exposed last October by chief executive Michael Woodford, who was sacked by the Olympus board after querying dubious deals later found to have been used to conceal the losses.Revelations of the huge accounting fraud revived calls for more outside scrutiny of its boardrooms but have failed to trigger sweeping corporate governance reforms similar to those introduced a decade ago in the wake of U.S. scandals such as at Enron.“The full responsibility lies with me and I feel deeply sorry for causing trouble to our business partners, shareholders and the wider public,” ex-chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa told the Tokyo district court at the start of the trial nearly a year after the cover-up first came to light.“I take full responsibility for what happened.”Prosecutors charged Kikukawa, former executive vice-president Hisashi Mori and former auditor Hideo Yamada with inflating the company’s net worth in financial statements for five fiscal years to March 2011.The three former executives had been identified by an investigative panel, commissioned by Olympus, as the main suspects in the fraud seeking to delay the reckoning from risky investments made in the late-1980s bubble economy.The indictment did not specify what penalties the prosecutors would seek, but lawyers have said the former executives could face up to 10 years in jail and fines of up to 10 million yen ($128,400). The company could be fined more than 100 million yen, according to the Japanese media.What if any impact the company’s guilty plea will have on Olympus will depend on what sentence, including a possible fine, the court hands down, said Tsuyoshi Oshima, a spokesman for the medical equipment maker. That decision, he said could be several months away.“Lawsuits from shareholders are possible,” Oshima said. The drop in Olympus’s share price has already spurred 12 lawsuits, including 11 in Japan, he said.Woodford had campaigned to win his job back, but has since given up, blaming cozy ties between management and big Japanese shareholders and citing the strain on his family.Olympus has already admitted it used improper accounting to conceal massive investment losses under a scheme that began in the 1990s.In December, it filed five years’ worth of corrected financial statements plus overdue first-half results, revealing a $1.1 billion dent in its balance sheet.With its share price hit by the scandal and a hole blown in its finances, the company has been struggling to secure funds to cover its losses, triggering talk it would need to merge or forge a business tie-up to raise capital.On Tuesday, three sources familiar with the deal said rival electronics and entertainment giant Sony Corp. was likely to approve a plan this week to invest 50 billion yen ($642 million) in Olympus, becoming its biggest shareholder with around a 10 percent.($1 = 77.8750 Japanese yen)Additional reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka, Reiji Murai and Maki Shiraki; Editing by Tomasz Janowski and Jonathan ThatcherOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

A man accused of stealing over $46,000 from home improvement stores in 10 different counties, including Cobb, was arrested at The Home Depot in Vinings and booked into the local jail, public records show.Cobb County police apprehended 51-year-old Dhouruba Bin Assante of Winston, Georgia, at The Home Depot on Cumberland Parkway near Paces Ferry Road around 8:45 p.m. on Jan. 18, according to his jail record.Investigators have since discovered Assante is out on bail in Athens-Clarke County and is also wanted in Gwinnett County and Peachtree City, accused of impersonation, theft and fraud.Detective Benjamin Jackson, of the Cobb County Police Department, said Assante stole approximately $46,087 from various stores in a fraudulent refund scheme involving 54 transactions in 10 counties using 45 separate driver’s licenses in 41 different names.“Of that, $5,118 was stolen in Cobb County at six different Home Depot stores between Nov. 18 and Dec. 12, 2019,” Jackson wrote in Assante’s most recent arrest warrant on Jan. 31.Assante remains in the Cobb jail without bond, facing felony counts of theft by deception, identity theft fraud and possessing or displaying false information for a criminal act. He is also charged locally with a misdemeanor count of shoplifting, records show.Cobb police said Jackson would enter The Home Depot and other stores and select merchandise, then walk it directly to the returns counter without paying for it, and use different driver’s licenses to return the merchandise. In this way, he stole over $46,000 from the franchises, receiving $5,118 in Home Depot gift cards in Cobb alone.When he was apprehended in Vinings on Jan. 18, police found him in possession of two fake South Carolina driver’s licenses, warrants show.Jackson said Assante’s charges in Athens-Clarke County relate to similar thefts at Lowe’s, another home improvement retailer.“When interviewed in Athens-Clarke County, said accused admitted to using fake IDs to commit frauds throughout the state,” Assante’s Jan. 31 Cobb County arrest warrant states. “Said accused was captured on video at each store in Cobb County.”While in Cobb’s custody, Assante is also subject to a “hold” order by Peachtree City, his jail record states.

A real estate broker who sold ritzy properties around South Florida pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal fraud charges involving more than $5.5 million.     Christopher White, 44, of Fort Lauderdale, admitted that he pressured clients to send him large deposits — which he was supposed to keep safe in escrow accounts — but used the money to pay his personal expenses, reimburse other clients and even pay his criminal defense lawyer.     Advertisement         White, owner of the Fort Lauderdale-based Chris White Group, refused to return about $595,000 worth of real estate deposits to three different clients who wanted to buy properties in Broward County this year.     During a lengthy hearing in federal court Wednesday, White admitted that he lied and falsified information when he applied for a $4.9 million mortgage to buy a waterfront home on Fort Lauderdale's Sea Island Drive in 2006, a property he later lost in foreclosure.                Advertisement         The Jamaican-born man also pleaded guilty to lying when he applied for U.S. citizenship in April.     White pleaded guilty to a total of 10 federal charges: One count of wire fraud affecting a financial institution; six counts of wire fraud; and three counts of making a false statement on his citizenship application.               Federal prosecutors Thomas Lanigan and Randy Katz told U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas that they expect to recommend a prison term of about three years and five months in federal prison. He also faces deportation.     Things started going downhill for White in January, when federal authorities questioned him about his own mortgage and, they said, he admitted that he had committed mortgage fraud.          White remained free because he appeared to be cooperating and the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office needed more time to complete their investigation, which involved tracking down and analyzing large amounts of documentation.     But authorities later found out that White applied for citizenship in April and ticked the ""No"" box in response to three important questions about whether he had ever committed a crime of any kind, denying that he had ever claimed to be a U.S. citizen and claiming he had never failed to pay child support.     All three answers were lies, prosecutors said. He knew he had committed mortgage fraud, he had been sued and had his driver's license suspended for not paying child support and he falsely claimed to be a U.S. citizen on several mortgage applications and other legal documents, according to his plea agreement.     White was arrested on the immigration charges in September and released on $150,000 bond. He was re-arrested earlier this month and held without bond on the charges that he took clients' money and refused to give it back.          Prosecutors filed the final fraud charge, linked to his home purchase, this week.     In court, White replied to questions from Dimitrouleas with a polite ""Yes, your honor"" and ""No, your honor.""

He admitted he tried to pressure clients into giving him much bigger deposits than he needed and that he used that money for his own benefit. He also admitted that he claimed to have millions of dollars in the bank and a monthly salary of $225,000 when he applied for his own mortgage.     Prosecutors said he falsified documents to make it look like he had a lot more money than he did.

White will remain locked up and is scheduled for sentencing Jan. 21 in Fort Lauderdale.

		70 charges brought against 4 Kyle suspects accused of burglary, fraud	

Crime

Bryan Drake and Rhonda Alexander (Kyle Police Department)









KYLE, Texas (KXAN) — Four arrests in September brought a total of 70 charges in vehicle burglaries, fraud, identity theft and credit/debit card abuse, Kyle police report.
The first arrest happened on the morning of Sept. 2. 
A resident called Kyle police reporting someone breaking into their car on Cowboy Cove. Kyle police found the suspect and attempted to initiate a traffic stop. The suspect reportedly tried to drive away and then run. Officers say they found the suspect in the backyard of a home and took him into custody. 
The suspect was identified as a 16-year old from the Austin area. Officers said he had a stolen vehicle — where they found other stolen items including 19 credit/debit cards and 35 documents with identifying information.  
The suspect was taken to the Hays County Juvenile Detention Center where he was charged with 19 counts of credit/debit card abuse, three counts driver’s license theft, and one count of each of the following: possession of identifying information, evading arrest/detention with a motor vehicle, evading arrest/detention, and unauthorized use of vehicle, according to the memo. 
The charges were classified as three state jail felonies, one second degree felony, a third degree felony, and a Class B misdemeanor. 


		Several car burglaries reported in one Williamson County neighborhood	

At around 2 a.m on Sept. 14, Kyle Police Department received a call about two teenagers parking their truck on Paddington Drive, turning off the lights, and getting out to check door handles of nearby cars on Paddington Drive, according to the memo. 
When officers arrived they located the truck and say they saw crack, marijuana, and a sawed off Ruger .22 rifle inside the vehicle. The officers located both suspects and took them into custody. Both suspects were identified as 16-year olds from the Austin area, one being the same suspect in the Sept. 2 incident. 
Both suspects were taken to Hays County Juvenile Detention Center. 
One was charged with unlawful carrying of a weapon, a Class A misdemeanor. Both suspects received two charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession of a dangerous drug, possession of marijuana <2 oz, burglary of a motor vehicle, theft of property, and evading arrest/detention, according to the memo. 
The charges for both suspects were classified as two state jail felonies, three Class A misdemeanors, and two Class B misdemeanors. 
Byran Drake, 44, was charged with 10 counts of credit card abuse and other 14 charges (Kyle Police Department) 
On Sept. 22, a Kyle police officer identified a stolen motorcycle in the parking lot of at Exxon located off Interstate 35. The suspect, identified as 44-year-old Bryan Drake from Dallas, had a warrant out for his arrest in Dallas County, according to the memo. 
While searching the motorcycle officers found credit cards, mail, and items of fraud identification information. They also found a room card key to a motel in Kyle.  
In the motel room, officers say they found more mail, fraudulent IDs, receipts with fraudulent purchases from Kyle businesses, a stolen check and items to create or tamper with credit cards. 
Drake was taken to Hays Count Jail and received 14 charges. His charges include 10 counts of credit card abuse, one count of mail theft, and one count of possession of identifying information, according to the memo. 
On that same evening, a Kyle police officer reportedly saw a gray Tahoe with fake temporary tags at a Stripes gas station off North Interstate 35. 
Rhonda Alexander, 47, was charged with 14 counts of credit card abuse and fraudulent use/possession of ID (Kyle Police Department)
The officer says he found the owner, Kyle resident Rhonda Alexander, 47, putting gas into her car who then consented to a search of the car. The officer reportedly found one Florida ID, 14 credit cards, three Texas IDs, and two Lone Star cards that did not belong Alexander. 
Alexander was taken to Hays County Jail and charged with 14 counts of credit card abuse and one count of fraudulent use/possession of ID, according to the memo. The charges were a state jail felony and a third degree felony, respectively. 
Barnett said the arrests were made thanks to residents and officers who called it in. Residents are asked to call police and watch the suspect from the safety of their home if they see someone trying to burglarize a vehicle in their neighborhood. 
“We always want to encourage our residents, if you see something, please say something,” said Kyle Police Chief Jeff Barnett.

Save 83%.SUBSCRIBE NOWOnly $5 for 3 months. Save 83%.News Sports Autos Entertainment Nation / World Obituaries E-Edition LegalsSubscribe MICHIGANSuit dismissed over false fraud charges; court says jobless claimants filed too latePaul EganDetroit Free PressView Comments LANSING — The Michigan Court of Appeals on Tuesday dismissed a class-action  brought by unemployment insurance claimants falsely accused of fraud by a state computer system, saying the lawsuit was filed too late.The state has acknowledged that at least 20,000 Michigan residents — and possibly as many as 40,000 — were wrongly accused of fraud by a $47-million state computer system that the state operated without human supervision and with an error rate as high as 93%.Those wrongly accused of fraud through robo-adjudications by the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS) were subjected to highest-in-the-nation quadruple penalties and many were subjected to aggressive collection techniques such as wage garnishment and seizure of income tax refunds.Read more:Time for Snyder, Schuette to make unemployment scandal rightJobless claimants, falsely accused of fraud, frustrated by legal argumentsDismissal of the suit on a legal technicality — how soon after the alleged harm the lawsuit was filed — will be appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court, said Royal Oak attorney Jennifer Lord, who said the ruling is ""incredible,"" and ""based on circular logic.""The unanimous opinion by a three-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed a March 2016 ruling by Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens, who said the lawsuit, filed in September 2015, could proceed.""We're really disappointed, but we've always planned on taking this as far as we need to, no matter how long it takes,"" Lord told the Free Press.Wanda Stokes, director of the Talent Investment Agency, which oversees the Unemployment Insurance Agency, said she agrees with the opinion but, ""it does not change the ongoing focus ... regarding the review of our unemployment insurance cases and improving customer service and integrity.""Stokes said a review of about 50,000 fraud determinations made between 2013 and 2015 is nearly completed and any money wrongly taken will be returned. So far the state has returned more than $16 million, she said.Lord, representing the plaintiffs, maintains hundreds of millions of dollars were wrongly taken and the claimants, who in some cases were forced into bankruptcy, are also entitled to damages.Under state law, the suit alleging violation of the constitutional right to due process, had to be filed within six months of the injury to the jobless claimants.Lord argued the damage was done when the state wrongly seized money from lead plaintiff Grant Bauserman and other jobless claimants, and the suit was timely.But the panel agreed with the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency's position that the harm occurred when the state ""issued notices informing plaintiffs of its determination that plaintiffs had engaged in fraudulent conduct."" Using that standard, the suit was filed too late.""Plaintiffs in this case erroneously focus on the potential consequence of a due process violation, the taking of their property, rather than the hallmark of a due process claim, the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard,"" said the opinion from Judges Michael Gadola, Patrick Meter and Karen Fort Hood.Lord said the ruling means those harmed would have to have filed lawsuits based on speculation that they might be harmed. Courts would rule such lawsuits premature, she said.The state notified one of the named plaintiffs, Teddy Broe, of the fraud allegations against him by sending a message to Broe's online unemployment insurance account in the summer of 2014, according to the ruling made by Stephens. But Broe, who collected benefits in 2012, had found a new job in November 2013 and no longer had a reason to check his account. Broe didn't find out about the interest and penalties until 2015, and his income tax refunds were seized in May 2015, according to the Stephens ruling quoted in Tuesday's Court of Appeals opinion.Another named plaintiff, Karl Williams of Lansing, whose wages are still being garnished over an alleged debt to the agency of more than $50,000, told the Free Press he's not surprised by the decision, but ""the State of Michigan really does need to be held accountable for what they have done and the mistakes they have made.""He said he doesn't understand the logic of the court's decision, in terms of when the state harmed him and the other plaintiffs. ""If you shoot somebody, the damage is not done until that bullet hits them,"" Williams said.Lord said the ruling ""is going to embolden agencies, potentially, to continue to use programs like MiDAS and continue to take actions such as switching water sources for Flint without proper treatment.""The agency still uses MiDAS, but stopped using it without human oversight in August 2015. Stokes, who came on board in July 2016, replaced the director of the UI Agency and launched a ""top-to-bottom review"" of agency practices.""We are working tirelessly to restore the public’s trust in our system, and we are on the road to doing that,"" she said Tuesday.Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon issued a statement attacking Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette, a likely candidate for governor, whose attorneys are representing the state agency in the case.""The lives of thousands of Michigan workers were made a living hell when they were falsely accused of defrauding a system in which they did everything right and followed all the rules,"" Dillon said.""Anyone even thinking about running for governor should be absolutely ashamed for seeking to deny people, irreparably harmed by the State of Michigan, their day in court.""Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for Schuette, did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

		Ex-CHOP VP Pleads Guilty to Fraud, Laundering	

			Roosevelt Hairston faces up to seven years in prison and up to $1M in fines.		


					By Kelly Bayliss							•

Published July 13, 2011 •
Updated on July 13, 2011 at 1:23 pm 



















The executive vice president of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia pleaded guilty Wednesday to fraud, money laundering and other offenses stemming from his $1.7 million embezzlement over the last 12 years, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Authorities say that between 1999 and February 14, 2011, 46-year-old Roosevelt Hairston Jr. used dozens of fake invoices he created to steal from CHOP.

According to a press release, the former-VP used the funds he stole from the Children’s Hospital to live a lavish lifestyle – which included a home in Malvern, Pa. – the purchase of various other real estate, a yacht and high-end cars. 

Hairston’s sentencing is set for October 13, 2011. He’s facing up to seven years in jail and up to a million dollars in fines

ALBANY — Veteran Bronx Assemblywoman Carmen Arroyo — no stranger to charges of campaign law violations — faces petition fraud claims from an upstart primary challenger.     Amanda Septimo, a 29-year-old labor organizer backed by the Working Families Party, says signatures Arroyo collected to get on the Democratic primary ballot were illegally backdated, according to a court challenge filed this week.     Advertisement         Documents included with Septimo’s challenge show Arroyo’s campaign picked up the petition sheets on Feb. 27.     However, hundreds of signatures the 84-year-old incumbent submitted to the Board of Elections are dated Feb. 25 and 26.                Advertisement         “It’s just brazen,” Septimo told the Daily News. “This feels like something that is so brazen and egregious that it feels like someone who is comfortable playing outside of the lines, used to not being held accountable, and then got sloppy.”     According to the court filing, 512 of the 944 signatures collected by the Arroyo campaign are dated before the 27th and in some cases dates appear to have been altered.               Gov. Cuomo lowered the signature threshold for Assembly candidates to just 150 due to the coronavirus crisis. The Democratic primary is scheduled for June 23.     But Septimo wants a judge to toss all of her incumbent competitor’s petitions, arguing that the backdating and other irregularities show the petitions are rife with fraud.          “There is such an air of presumed ability to get away with anything that you just do anything, right? And this feels like another example of that and we’ve seen the assemblywoman caught up other scandals.”     Arroyo said she never had a chance to review the petitions because she was in and out of the hospital at the time for a medical condition and was busy with work in Albany ahead of the budget.     “I’m surprised about what she’s doing. There were some people who made mistakes, the volunteers who were working for me because I was sick and going back and forth to Albany, and I didn’t have the time to deal with the petitions,” Arroyo told The News. “There’s nothing I can do now.”     The longtime lawmaker is confident that she’ll be on the ballot come June.          “It’s up to the court,” she added. “There’s very little I can do. I know I have more than 150 signatures that are good.”      Most Read        Jets players alert NFLPA about hidden locker room cameras at team facility                ’He was a loving child’: Bronx dad with pregnant girlfriend gunned down behind the wheel of parked car                Man shot to death inside Brooklyn lounge                   Arroyo, who joined the Assembly in 1994, and her daughter, former councilwoman Maria del Carmen Arroyo, have both repeatedly faced allegations of questionable dealings in the past, including funneling city money to family-run nonprofits and misusing campaign funds.     Arroyo’s grandson served time in federal prison over a decade ago for embezzling $115,000 from a nonprofit founded by the assemblywoman and spending some of the pilfered funds on his grandmother.     In 2015, Arroyo avoided prosecution over possible misuse of campaign funds, including purchases made at a casino, after the state Board of Elections referred the case to then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office, but no criminal intent was discovered.

José Serrano’s district director and with the Legal Aid Society, failed to unseat Arroyo in 2018. losing the Democratic primary and then the general election under the WFP ballot line. The political upstart is hoping things will be different this time around.     “All the work I have done in my career has touched my neighborhood in one way or another,” she said. “Right now, I think specifically, the moment calls for leaders who are willing to fight the big fights.”            Recommended on Daily News                   Advertisement                                    Advertisement                                          Most Read See more Most Read articles                Jets players alert NFLPA about hidden locker room cameras at team facility     2h                Man shot to death inside Brooklyn lounge     1h                ’He was a loving child’: Bronx dad with pregnant girlfriend gunned down behind the wheel of parked car     Nov 6, 2020                              Advertisement                                                                   Advertisement     "

The trial surrounding Goatse Security’s 2010 collection and disclosure of AT&T iPad users’ emails has come to a close — one that again calls into question the legitimacy of the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. 27-year-old Andrew Auernheimer, who goes by the name ""weev"" online, was found guilty in a New Jersey court on one count of identity fraud and one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization. That means the defendant is facing two consecutive five-year felonies for his online exploits. But what makes the case significant is that Auernheimer cracked no codes, stole no passwords, or in any way ""broke into"" AT&T’s customer database — something company representatives confirmed during testimony.
Back in 2010, AT&T was making its iPad 3G users’ email addresses available to anyone with the associated ICC-ID — a unique number that authenticates the user’s SIM card to AT&T. According to chat transcripts posted by Wired, Auernheimer and 27-year-old Daniel Spitler (who accepted a plea bargain last year) wrote a script that randomly pinged AT&T's website with ICC-IDs, harvesting the email addresses it spit out. In the end, the two compiled a list of about 114,000 users, allegedly including people like Michael Bloomberg, Rahm Emanuel, and Diane Sawyer, before contacting Gawker in June to report their findings. By this time AT&T had already fixed the security hole.
""Have you ever received permission from Google to go to Google?""
The 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which Auernheimer was found to have violated, predates the web and contains language that is frequently criticized for being unintelligibly vague in an era of ubiquitous networked computers. The Act makes it illegal to ""access a computer without authorization or exceed authorized access"" on any ""protected computer"" — for instance, one that is ""used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication."" TechNews Daily reports that while the jury was deliberating, Auernheimer said to the press, ""the ‘protected computer’ is any network computer. You access a protected computer every day,"" before asking rhetorically, ""have you ever received permission from Google to go to Google?""
""The 'protected computer' is any network computer.""
Despite the guilty verdicts, Auernheimer remained upbeat, reportedly saying the jury’s decision was largely due to the general population’s comparative computer illiteracy, and telling his Twitter followers that he planned to appeal the case. Following the verdict, Auernheimer stressed, ""R. David Halsey from AT&T used the words, ‘there was no security bypass.’ It can’t be clearer than that. The definition of ‘unauthorized access’ has to include the bypass of security measures.""

Hey epals don't worry! We went in knowing there would be a guilty here. I'm appealing of course.

A Pella man faces federal prison time for his role in a fraud scheme committed over several years. Mark Alan Blankespoor was sentenced to 80 months of prison by United States District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger for wire fraud on Friday, according to United States Attorney Marc Krickbaum. Blankespoor was ordered by the Court to serve three years of supervised release following the prison term. Additionally, he must pay $8,464,103 in restitution to over 100 victims. The defendant pleaded guilty to wire fraud in June of this year. According to court documents, Blankespoor was a health coach and consultant in Pella and represented to others he was involved in developing medically-oriented gyms and licensed the program to fitness clinics across the United States. For more than four years, Blankespoor represented to investors they had an opportunity to make money by investing in the medically-oriented gym concept. At least 100 investors provided Blankespoor with approximately $15 million in investment funds. Blankespoor admitted he used the investors’ money for unauthorized purposes that were not for the benefit of the investors. He used the money, unbeknownst to the victims, for his personal expenses and paying other investors to further the scheme. The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated this matter. The case was prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Iowa. KNIA/KRLS reached out to Blankespoor’s attorney for a statement in June after the guilty plea, and Attorney Guy Cook sent the following then:
“Mark Blankespoor is a respected physical therapist, certified health coach, and successful businessman. He has been so for more than twenty years. Blankespoor plead guilty to one count of fraud of a 24 count indictment before U.S. Magistrate Judge Celeste Bremer. He did so to accept responsibility for his actions and an investment effort that failed. The plea follows an agreement reached with the government.”

The FBI says that over 70 different businesses were defrauded of the amount. The fugitives are accused of sending spoofed emails to thousands of businesses requesting fraudulent wire services.



The Nigerians are also accused of working with money launderers, romance scammers, and others involved in BEC schemes “through a complex web of witting and unwitting people in the United States and abroad.”
Uzuh and Ogunshakin are alleged to have conducted their own BEC Schemes; while learning from Uzuh, Ogunshakin provided the bank accounts to him, Benson, Kayode and Okpo, whose accounts were used to receive fraudulent wire transfers. Okpoh alone is accused of providing bank accounts for receiving fraudulent transfers valued at $1 million.

Uzuh was indicted in October 2016 in the United States District Court, District of Nebraska, Omaha, Nebraska, on wire fraud charges and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while the other co-conspirators were indicted in August 2019 at the same district court and had Federal warrants issued for their arrests.


 
Meanwhile, Micheal Olorunyomi, who was indicted in November 2019, is accused of defrauding victims of over $1 million by targeting vulnerable elders or widows through romance fraud schemes.

Twitter labels 38% of President Trump’s tweets since Tuesday ‘misleading’
Twitter stepped up its effort to fact-check President Donald Trumps’s tweets and retweets.

Twitter has labeled 38% of 29 tweets and retweets in three days with warnings that said he made misleading claims about the electoral process.
This was disclosed by The New York Times on Thursday.





According to the news platform, since early Tuesday morning, the micro-blogging site has stepped up its effort to fact-check the president, labeling 38% of his 29 tweets and retweets with warnings that said he made misleading claims about the electoral process.

It said, “Twitter added labels to 11 of Mr. Trump’s tweets or retweets (although one tweet that Mr. Trump had shared was later deleted by its author).
“Most of the labels said Mr. Trump had shared content that was disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.




“But one tweet, in which Mr. Trump preemptively claimed to have won Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, was marked with a small reminder that those races had not yet been called.”

Trump’s response







Samantha Zager, the deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said,
“Big tech interfered against President Trump before Election Day, and they are now continuing that interference in the days after as they silence the president on their platforms.

“The American people deserve to know what is happening with this election, but big tech is only interested in stopping the flow of information to voters.”
Meanwhile, a Twitter spokesman reportedly said the company planned to continue to take action against tweets that prematurely declare victory or contain misleading information.

An Arizona Department of Economic Security employee and a Phoenix police officer were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of theft, fraud and money laundering. According to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, DES alerted them to possible theft involving 39-year-old Autumn Vasquez Maya.DPS launched an investigation and tracked several other criminal activities, including more than $3,000 in currency, firearms and police body cameras that had been stolen. DPS says Maya is suspected of pawning the items at Valley pawn shops. According to court paperwork, on Nov. 28, 2017, it was discovered $3,488 was missing from a safe at the DES offices. The money was initially placed in an envelope but had been replaced with white copy paper cut into the size of bills. During the investigation, it was discovered Maya had access to the safe and periodically conducted audits of the firearms in the safe, court documents stated. On March 12, Maya was interviewed by officials, court documents said. She became “extremely defensive” and denied touching the inside of the envelope — despite her fingerprints being found on tape sealing the envelope. After Maya was identified as a primary suspect in the case, a records check was completed for further review. During the formal workup, it was discovered Maya had several recent transactions at Valley pawn shops, court paperwork said. Between May 5, 2017, and Oct. 26, 2017, Maya pawned five firearms. On March 22, authorities visited a pawn shop in Scottsdale that Maya frequented and spoke with the general manager, court documents said. The manager explained that he recalled seeing Maya and a man later identified as her husband come into the store that same morning to pawn another item and remove a firearm. Maya had been employed with DES since 2016. Officials contacted the Arizona Attorney General’s Office where Maya previously worked as a property custodian, court paperwork said. The AAG’s said Maya had several “performance issues” and “integrity concerns” during her employment. While working at the AAG’s office, $2,000 went missing from a safe and it's believed she pawned an AAG-owned weapon.Maya's husband Michael, a Phoenix police officer, was also arrested as a co-conspirator. ""It was pretty shocking what happened. Police came out in their tactical gear. There were about 10 vehicles that came up, and they were banging on the door. You could hear them yelling open up, police, open up,"" said Rhowen Mendoza, Maya's neighbor. ""I mean you never know what people are capable of.""Michael told investigators that he knew Maya had pawned items at various pawn shops and helped her retrieve two state-owned firearms after she was placed on administrative leave, court paperwork said. He said prior to the incident, he was unaware that she had pawned the state-owned firearms. However, because Michael had been identified by employees of several pawn shops on various occasions, investigators say they believe he was, “actively participating in the ongoing conspiracy to traffic stolen state property.” A Phoenix police spokesperson said they have begun the procedures to terminate his employment. Phoenix Police said he has been with their department for 24 years. Maya was booked into jail on charges including theft, fraud, forgery, trafficking stolen property, money laundering, and conspiracy. Michael Maya was booked into jail on trafficking stolen property, money laundering, and conspiracy. Both were released on bond and will return to court on April 19.

By Little India Desk | February 9, 2018 Share Tweet Share ShareThe Pune Police arrested three people after raiding a fake call center, which allegedly defrauded 11,000 Americans, in the Koregaon Park area on Feb. 5. The United States federal government’s Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are investigating the matter with Pune Police’s economic and cyber crimes cell, according to the Times of India.The police also found details of two other similar call centers being run in two different states in India but haven’t revealed the whereabouts of the centers or the people running them, citing ongoing investigations. The U.S. authorities are being kept updated with the developments in each case.The police are also monitoring the amount of money the call center in Pune made by threatening United States citizens with punishment for tax evasion. Four other suspects have been identified but are yet to arrested.“The IRS and the FTC, which is a federal agency for the protection of consumers, have decided to extend their help to our probe,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Sudhir Hiremath told the publication. “The suspects have used the names of American agencies extensively while issuing the threats. They forced U.S. citizens to pay amounts ranging from $500 to $1,000 by threatening them with severe punishment if caught by the IRS for evading taxes.”This is not the first such case in Pune, Maharashtra. Pune Police raided another call center in Kharadi, Pune, in January 2018 and arrested two for cheating 175 U.S. nationals of Rs 10.5 lakh since August 2017.“The call center had tied up with an American advertising agency to send pop-up ads on smartphones and tablets of the targeted U.S. citizens. If an unsuspecting victim ever clicked on the pop-up, his/her device would immediately get locked. Later, the victim would receive a message to contact a specific number and pay a certain amount (in dollars) to get the phone unlocked,” Hiremath added, according to the report.Earlier in 2017, another call center scam was busted in Maharashtra, leading to the arrest of 14 people in Mumbai, who allegedly duped U.S. nationals for $300 million.

Former Registered Broker Pleads Guilty to Participating in a Multi-Million Dollar Securities Fraud Scheme

3 mins read




































BROOKLYN, NY – Defendant Engaged in Unauthorized Trading in Customers’ Account and Generated Over $2 Million in Commissions and Fees for Brokerage Firm





Earlier today, in federal court in Brooklyn, Joshua Turney, formerly a registered broker at Global Arena Capital Corp. (“Global”), a now defunct brokerage firm located in New York City, pleaded guilty before United States District Judge Eric N. Vitaliano to conspiracy to commit securities fraud for engaging in unauthorized trading in his customers’ accounts.  When sentenced, Turney faces up to five years in prison, as well as restitution, criminal forfeiture and a fine.
Seth D. DuCharme, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI) announced the guilty plea.



“With today’s guilty plea, Turney has been held accountable for abusing the trust of his customers and for engaging in unauthorized trades to unjustly enrich himself,” stated Acting United States Attorney DuCharme.  “This Office will continue to work vigilantly alongside our law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of financial markets.” Mr. DuCharme expressed his grateful appreciation to the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Regional Office (SEC), for its significant cooperation and assistance during the investigation.
“The scheme Turney and his co-conspirators are accused of today is fairly straightforward. As alleged, they pushed through more than $100 million in customer trades, most of which were unauthorized, for the sole purpose of generating commission for themselves.  In Turney’s case, reaping the benefits of his proceeds, however, won’t be quite as simple now that he’s been charged with a federal crime,” stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney.
According to court filings and facts presented at the plea hearing, between April 2015 and June 2015, shortly before Global ceased operations, Turney and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud Global customers by purchasing and selling securities without the customers’ prior authorization or knowledge.  Approximately 4,500 trades were executed in approximately 360 customer accounts during this time period, most of which were unauthorized.  The principal value of these transactions was approximately $106 million, and the trades generated over $2.44 million in commissions and fees for Global.

Eight arrested in area Medicaid fraud investigation

Eight people have been arrested and charged in Burke and Richmond counties as part of an investigation into Medicaid fraud.
Reuben Rice, 31, of Houston, Texas; Thomas Alwell, 36, of Augusta; Mark Speigner, 65, of Houston; and Emery Eubanks, 22, of Sesser, Ill., were arrested in Burke County. Rice, Alwell and Speigner were charged with felony forgery in the first degree and felony criminal attempt, conspiracy and solicitation to defraud Medicaid, according to the Burke County Sheriff’s Office. Eubanks was charged with criminal attempt, conspiracy and solicitation. They are being held at the Burke County Detention Center.
Thomas Eubanks, 19, of Christopher, Ill.; Joseph Garcia, 31, of Houston; James Dylan, 21, of Peoria, Ill., and Timothy Smith, 38, of Struthers, Ohio, were arrested in Richmond County. All four were charged with felony unlawful acts, in reference to public medical assistance.
They were arrested at a hotel by members of the Crimes Against the Vulnerable and Elderly task force from the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office and Richmond County Marshal's Office and are being held at the Charles B. Webster Detention Center.
On Saturday, Waynesboro police and the Burke County Sheriff’s Office started receiving complaints about people in medical scrubs in the Pilgrim Way area asking to conduct medical tests and seeking personal information, according to the sheriff’s office.
The four arrested in Burke County were charged Sunday, while the four arrested in Richmond County were charged Monday. Burke County Chief Deputy Lewis Blanchard said all eight worked together in the scam.
The Burke County Sheriff’s Office and CAVE investigators found evidence in a hotel room that will be used for additional charges. The investigation also found evidence at another hotel.
The sheriff's office determined those arrested were illegally obtaining information that was then sent out of state and used for illegal billing of medical tests and other services. The scammers use the Medicaid number to pay for services that the victims could later be denied because Medicaid will show they've already been performed.
The sheriff’s office said there are reports of others working the scam in the area and throughout the state.
Blanchard said the scammers are targeting the elderly and those with lower socioeconomic status. The eight people arrested do not live in the area and were staying in Richmond County hotels. He expects additional charges will be filed against all of them.
Anyone who has been approached by people offering free medical services, free DNA swabs for the elderly or seeking personal information or Medicaid information can contact the sheriff’s office’s Criminal Investigative Division at (706) 554-2133, District Attorney's Office investigator William Loomer at (706) 821-1150, or local law enforcement.

AdvertisementThe question now is, will he actually spend time in jail, or will being rich and white win out yet again?According to WKYC, Pascal Mahvi, who has been dubbed the “Food Stamp Millionaire,” was convicted  Friday of two fraud-related charges stemming from his acceptance and use of all the welfare benefits that are usually meant to be provided to those in need. AdvertisementHis sentencing is expected to come within the next four to six weeks, and prosecutors are supposedly seeking jail time for the wealthy Geauga County man. “We’re absolutely going to recommend time behind bars,” Prosecutor James Flaiz said. “I think people have to understand, if you abuse the system that taxpayers have set up to help the poor and you defraud that system, there needs to be consequences.”G/O Media may get a commissionPhilips Hue Lights (3-Pack)$99 at AmazonMahvi could face up to 18 months in prison, prosecutors say, and could also be made to make restitution for the benefits that he did receive.However, as WKYC notes, Ohio law does suggest probation for low-level, first-time offenders, and Mahvi was convicted on a fifth-degree felony charge for food stamp fraud and a misdemeanor for making false or misleading statements in his Medicaid application, so whether or not he will receive adequate sentencing is yet to be seen. AdvertisementLast year, Mahvi’s little scheme blew wide open after investigators revealed that he failed to disclose the entirety of his wealth, including his $800,000 Russell Township home, an in-ground swimming pool, multiple cars, stabled horses and undeveloped property that is tagged at being worth tens of millions of dollars in the beautiful Caribbean island of St. Lucia.Yet Mahvi claimed that he applied for welfare because his businesses failed and he had no choice but to turn his open hand to the government. AdvertisementMahvi’s attorney insisted that prosecutors were creating an “illusion of great wealth,” when Mahvi was, in fact, suffering, with his business ventures failing, his home in foreclosure and his St. Lucia property heavily mortgaged, leaving him no choice but to apply for welfare to provide for his wife and adult children. While the family was receiving food stamps from 2014 to 2016, however, investigators also discovered more than $1 million circulating around several family bank accounts. However, those records, a judge ruled, did not give an accurate or thorough accounting, and so Mahvi ended up being acquitted on two counts of grand theft. Advertisement“Testimony from a forensic accountant … would have been of great benefit to the parties and the court,” Judge Forrest Burt wrote in his decision. “Simply adding debits and credits into and out of the various accounts does not present an accurate representation of whether [Mahvi] did or did not disclose resources or income.”Read more at WKYC.

PNB has said it is working with the investigators and regulators probing the fraud case.The CBI is also questioning officers of overseas branches of Indian banks that extended credit facilities on the basis of the fraudulent letters of undertaking (LOUs), issued by employees of PNB, the source said.The agency has also summoned an officer dealing with foreign exchange at Allahabad Bank's ALBK.NS Hong Kong branch, for questioning, the source said.

John F. Casey, 56, the  former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Boston Grand Prix and former owner of an ice rink on Route 1 in Peabody was arrested Tuesday on charges that he allegedly  failed to repay nearly $1 million in loans he fraudulently procured in connection with the rink in a scheme to defraud equipment and small business financing companies, including $145,000 he received some two months after he sold the rink.
He was also charged with failure to report nearly $1 million in income he received from the race, a race that never took place, on his federal tax returns. 
Casey, a resident of Ipswich, was indicted on eight counts of wire fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, three counts of money laundering and three counts of filing false tax returns. Casey made an initial appearance in court Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald J. Cabell.
The indictment alleges that Casey owned an ice rink in Peabody, identified by an unnamed source as the Mass Bay Hockey Center, 216 Newbury St., between October 2013 and June 1, 2016. Between October 2014 and October 2016, Casey obtained more than $743,000 in funds from equipment financing companies, purportedly for the purchase of equipment for the ice rink. In addition, in August 2016, more than two months after he sold the Peabody rink, Casey obtained more than $145,000 in small business loans for the rink business. In order to secure the financing, Casey allegedly submitted materially false documents and information, including fake invoices for the equipment, bank records purporting to show deposits into Casey’s accounts related to the Peabody rink, falsely inflated personal and corporate tax returns, and personal financial statements falsely claiming ownership and value of various assets. 
Casey also allegedly submitted a fake Deed of Sale containing a forged signature in support of one of his loan applications. Relying on Casey’s false statements, the financing companies provided funding to Casey in amounts and on terms they otherwise would not have made. Most of the funds provided by the victim companies were never repaid. 
As alleged in the indictment, Casey became the CFO of the Boston Grand Prix in January 2015. The Boston Grand Prix organization made payments to or on behalf of Casey totaling approximately $308,292 in 2015 and $601,073 in 2016 which Casey failed to include in the gross income he claimed on his personal tax returns for those years.
Casey is also charged with laundering the proceeds of his fraud scheme, and with failing to include the income from his fraud scheme on his 2014, 2015 and 2016 personal federal tax returns. 
The charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of the greater of either $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss.  The charge of aggravated identity theft provides for a consecutive sentence of two years in prison, one year supervised release and a fine of the greater of either $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss. The charge of unlawful monetary transactions provides for a sentence of up to10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of the greater of either $250,000 or twice the value of the criminally derived property. The charge of filing false tax returns provides for a sentence of up to three years in prison, one year of supervised release and a fine of the greater of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

According to the FIR filed by bank manager Vineet Kumar Shukla, a local resident claiming himself to be owner of a car showroom in Greater Noida took a loan for 18 luxury cars by forging papers, a loan which he never repaid. The matter came to light when bank filed RTI to RTO in order to find about cars details and were astonished to know that only one VIP registration number was issued while for the remaining cars the papers were cancelled. According to SBI, the accused Rajat Kulshetra had claimed that he owned, M/S J R Automotive near CP Market Ansal Plaza in Greater Noida, but internal probe revealed, that there is no such showroom in Greater Noida. The loan was taken between December 27, 2014 and November 17 2015 from State Bank of Patiala, Sanjay Place branch, which was merged with SBI.  The loan amounts ranged from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Taking cognizance of the major scam, the then field officer Grijesh Gautam and branch manager R K Verma were suspended. Later, on January 31, 2017, Verma retired from service. In the FIR, Shukla have named Rajat Kulshetra of Vardaman house bank colony as the main accused and claimed that his wife Shalini Kulshetra and his 12 other associates identified as Yatendar , Abhay Kumar Singh, Deep Kumar, Akashya Kulshetra, Rajeev Kulshetra, Vinay Kumar Sharma, Mohit Jain, Anuj Pundhir, Sunil Pundhir, Vijay Kumar Gupta, Ajay Singhal and Mayank Agrawal were involved in the scam.

Several attempts were made to contact SBI public relations department, but none responded. Assistant superintendent of police, Raveen Tyagi said, âOur team will probe the matter and soon will crack the case to arrest the accused involved in the scam.â Earlier in January, two HDFC employees of Sanjay Place branch along with a local film producer siphoned off Rs 98 lakh from a dormant account of a local hospital director.

Chakravarthy (27), son of Munisamy from Panrutti in Cuddalore district and his relative Perumal (22), son of Rajendran from Sokkanenthal in Villupuram district, were nabbed by police after a Madurai- based woman preferred a complaint with the district police in this regard.  Lakshmi (name changed) from Madurai, stated in her complaint that she had registered on a matrimonial site for prospective alliances and a person approached her online addressing himself as Rahul Vijay, a rich youth from Namakkal. After befriending the girl through online chat and mobile communication, he expressed his wish to marry her but demanded money and jewels from the girl. He asked her to deposit Rs 50,000 in a bank account and collected 11 sovereigns of gold ornaments through some contacts. However, he later disconnected the online and phone contact. Lakshmi filed a complaint with the police and the duo were traced through the bank transactions and arrested by the district police.  Addressing media persons, DIG Balanaga Devi said the investigation revealed that Chakravarthy, the main accused, had cheated 17 girls through this method. Most of the women were well educated, working as nurses, college professors and IT professionals. âAfter establishing contact as a prospective bridegroom, he used to befriend the girls through social networking chats and the mobile. Further, they used the magic voice option on the mobile phone to pose as parents of the groom. After gaining their confidence, Chakravarthy used to demand money from the girls and asked them to deposit the cash in bank accounts. He also collected the money and jewels through his relative Perumal,â she said.  Even girls living abroad in places such as Mauritius and Gulf countries were among their victims. After collecting the money, Chakravarthy used to disconnect all communication with the girls and create new profiles to attract further victims, Nagadevi explained. Besides the valuables, Chakravarthy apparently blackmailed a few victims by taking semi-nude photographs of them through a webcam while chatting, to extract money from the girls, police said.  DIG Balanaga Devi has asked the public to come forward and file complaints with the police in case any of them have been cheated by Chakravarthy and his accomplice. âIf any other victims come forward to file complaints, police will take necessary action,â she said. The money and the jewels Chakaravarthy cheated Lakshmi of have been recovered, she said. Police also warned girls to be careful with matrimonial proposals coming online and thoroughly verify the credentials of those who posted profiles.

Former Anglo American executive accused of $9.8 million fraud

Cecilia Jamasmie | January 16, 2015 | 3:06 pm 
Energy Australia Europe Coal  



Anglo claims money purportedly destined to equipment and services for its Grosvenor underground project was instead siphoned off into private bank accounts in Barbados and London.
A fraud claim against former Anglo American (LON:AAL) executive Glenn James Tonkin has ballooned with his ex-employer accusing him of misappropriating $9.8 million, more than twice as much as previously thought.

Tonkin, 50, was accused in October last year of taking more than $4 million from Anglo’s Queensland coal business, allegedly for mine equipment and services, between 2013 and 2014.
However, the Brisbane-based project director didn’t acquired what he claimed. Instead, court documents show the funds were siphoned off into private bank accounts in Barbados and London.
Glenn James Tonkin.
Tonkin, who left Anglo in September – allegedly after he was confronted by Anglo’s head of human resources over suspicious emails –ran an elaborate scheme involving fake invoices, a New York consulting company that did not do any work, and email correspondence with a supposed supplier in Florida who did not exist.
Part of his work at the miner’s Grosvenor underground project at Moranbah, Central Queensland, involved signing off on payments to contractors, suppliers, and other companies taking part in the operation.
After freezing his assets and hiring investigators to probe his past, Anglo slapped Tonkin with another $5.3 million damages claim just before Christmas, Mining Australia reports. This time, the firm said he also misused company funds when he worked to expand a copper mine in South America between 2009 and 2011.
The case is set to return to court in Brisbane on January 29.

Daniel Melamed
The convictions keep coming for Daniel Melamed.
The notorious New York landlord who was previously convicted of illegally evicting tenants pleaded guilty on Monday to charges including mortgage fraud, grand larceny and forgery as part of a scheme to falsify loan documents and collect money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the New York Post.
Melamed also admitted to illegally buying a $250,000 property with a shell company in 2013. He sold it one year later for $1.25 million.
In June, Melamed was found guilty of shutting off the heat and performing illegal construction to try driving out tenants in his 14-unit Crown Heights multifamily building at 1578 Union Street, according to the New York Attorney General’s office.
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement that Melamed “stole money from taxpayers and cheated the public in order to boost his bottom line.” [NYP] – Eddie Small

        This undated booking photo provided by the Cobb County Sheriff in Marietta, Ga., shows Ernest Addo, 48. (AP)COLUMBIA, S.C. – A man stole a physician's identity and pretended to be a doctor for a year in South Carolina, and now investigators are combing through medical records to see whether he harmed any of the hundreds of patients he treated, authorities said.Ernest Addo of Austell, Ga., is charged with unlawful practice of medicine and obtaining goods under false pretense, authorities said.Addo doesn't have a medical license in the U.S. But he assumed a doctor friend's identity, getting a driver's license and presenting the massive amount of paperwork needed to prove he was a doctor. The documents were given to him by the friend in hopes they could open a medical clinic together when the real doctor returned from a yearlong trip to Ghana, Lexington County Sheriff James Metts said.The real doctor, Arthur Kennedy, said he is embarrassed and devastated by what his friend did.Addo did have some medical training, and acted enough like a doctor not to raise any serious suspicion beyond one nurse -- interviewed after Addo's Aug. 24, arrest -- who wondered why he consulted ask.com when she questioned his treatment plan, Metts said.The motive appears to be greed, the sheriff said. Court documents show Addo has a history of financial trouble.Records obtained by The Associated Press show in the past 20 years, at least two dozen liens have been filed against Addo for around $200,000, including unpaid rent, credit card bills, student loans and taxes. Addo has declared bankruptcy twice.After Addo's arrest last week at his Georgia home, officers found fake IDs and other documents, and Metts said it appears Addo might have tried to fake his way through other lucrative careers, too. The sheriff wouldn't specify which ones.""He seems to be a professional con guy,"" Metts said.Authorities have said Addo received more than $10,000 for his services but declined to elaborate. One of the jobs also gave him the use of a Mercedes.Addo, 48, has been jailed in Cobb County, Ga., since his arrest, and neither the sheriff nor jail officials knew if he had an attorney. Addo is refusing to talk to authorities, and both his home phone and cellphone have been disconnected.Addo faces more than a decade in prison for his current charges, but he could end up in even more trouble. Metts said his investigators are reviewing the medical records of more than 500 patients Addo saw while at four Columbia-area senior centers and a rehabilitation center owned by Agape Senior Primary Care.Metts said some of those patients died. He said more charges could follow if any of those deaths were linked to Addo's actions.Addo was hired as a general practitioner and provided the kind of exams patients would receive during a visit to the family doctor. Authorities said he also wrote prescriptions, including some for himself.Officials at Agape are doing their own review of the care patients received from Addo. They said he never had sole clinical oversight of any patient.""We have found no inappropriate diagnosis or plan of treatment. We are convinced that all of our patients are safe and receiving proper care,"" Agape CEO Scott Middleton said in a statement.Addo also worked as a contract doctor for the South Carolina Department of Mental Health, filling in for a doctor on medical leave. Officials there said they also are reviewing Addo's care and have not found any serious issues.Patients treated by Addo could not be located by The Associated Press for comment.Authorities started investigating Addo after he made a small mistake on a death certificate. South Carolina health officials trying to fix the error contacted the doctor Addo was impersonating. He told them he hadn't practiced medicine for a year in the state because he was teaching at a medical school in Ghana.Officials have refused to release that doctor's name, but Kennedy confirmed his identity was stolen.Kennedy said he was betrayed by his friend. Addo also obtained credit cards in Kennedy's name, creating an even bigger mess to clean up, the doctor said Wednesday outside his home in Orangeburg.He said he didn't want to answer detailed questions about what happened until he spoke to a lawyer.Both Kennedy and Addo are from Ghana. Kennedy ran unsuccessfully for president of the west African nation in 2008. He had a family practice in Orangeburg and spent plenty of time in his homeland, pushing for public health improvements. The two men resemble each other, and Addo used Kennedy's reputation to help get him the doctor jobs. Agape said in a statement it hired him in part because he came highly recommended.Both Agape and Jackson & Coker, the Alpharetta, Ga., physician recruitment firm that placed Addo with the Department of Mental Health, have promised to help authorities. Metts said it could take months for investigators to go through all the medical records.Jackson & Coker also is exploring any legal action it could take against Addo and is shocked he was able to obtain all the documents someone would need to prove he was a doctor in the United States, spokeswoman Susan Meyers said.""He was hired the same way in several different places,"" Meyers said. ""There were no red flags.""

Two women are facing fraud and conspiracy charges after Davenport police say they defrauded a Davenport credit union. Jamiah L. Quinn, 18, of Davenport, and Autumn M. McClendon, 21, of Milan, are charged with one count each of second-degree fraud and conspiracy to commit a non-forcible felony. Both charges are Class D felonies under Iowa law that carry a prison sentence of five years.The investigation began Sept. 20 when police were sent to Vibrant Credit Union, 3801 Brady St., regarding fraudulent bank accounts and activities connected to them.According to the arrest affidavit, the women would open an account and then place empty envelopes into automated teller machines in the area and declare the envelopes contained cash deposits.
They would then immediately make a cash withdrawal, draining the account. They continued this practice until the account was frozen, at which time one of them would open a new account and the process of false deposits and cash withdrawals would continue.
The women were able to obtain more than $1,500 but less than $10,000.McClendon was arrested Thursday and booked into the Scott County Jail. She was released from jail Friday on her own recognizance. She is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges Jan. 23 in Scott County District Court.

Quinn was arrested Friday evening and booked into the Scott County jail. She was being held Friday night on a $5,000 cash-only bond and is expected to make a first appearance Saturday in Scott County District Court.
The case remains under investigation.

A woman who ran a Maplewood tax preparation business has admitted helping a client defraud the government in order to obtain tax refunds, the US Attorney's Office said Monday. Zenobia Williams, 52, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the IRS in Newark federal court. She is scheduled to be sentenced in April. 
In 2016, her company, Maplewood Business Services, prepared a return for a New Jersey business owner reporting false labor expenses for the 2015 tax year. On January 5, 2016, Williams sent the business owner a text message, stating, “Hey Fella, I have 1 client right now that needs 15,750 in income. I need you to produce a 1099MISC form for that person. I will give you the information. Let me know how much more income you need to 1099.” Williams, working at the business owner's direction, prepared two 1099 forms falsely claiming that the business paid two people more than $27,000 combined. She also prepared a personal return for the business owner reporting the false expenses. 
Williams also reported the bogus business expenses as income on the tax returns of the two individuals referred to above, which resulted in both receiving unwarranted tax refunds from the IRS.Williams faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Paul Erickson, Russian Agent Maria Butina’s Boyfriend, Pleads Guilty to Fraud



CrosswordNewslettersCoronavirusCheat SheetPoliticsEntertainmentMediaWorld NewsHalf FullCultureU.S. NewsScoutedTravelCrime & JusticePaul Erickson, Russian Agent Maria Butina’s Boyfriend, Pleads Guilty to FraudConvicted ConmanErickson admits he conned someone called only “D.G.” into wiring him $100,000, under the pretense that the money was for a real estate investment in North Dakota. It was not.Betsy SwanFormer Political ReporterErin BancoNational Security ReporterUpdated Nov. 19, 2019 7:50PM ET / Published Nov. 18, 2019 6:06PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/GettyPaul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted Russian agent Maria Butina, has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering, according to a plea agreement filed in a South Dakota federal court Monday afternoon.In a two-page statement detailing the factual basis for the plea, Erickson said he conned someone only identified as “D.G.” into wiring him $100,000 under the pretense that the money was for a real estate investment in North Dakota. As part of the plea filed in U.S. district court in South Dakota, Erickson admits the money was not for a real estate deal. He also notes that he wired $1,000 of the money to a person called “M.B.” “My client, Paul Erickson, entered into a plea agreement with the federal government to resolve all charges leveled against him regarding his business practices of many years.  In pleading to two counts all other charges will be dismissed, and this ordeal for Mr. Erickson will come to an end,” said Clint Sargent, an attorney for Erickson. The case against Erickson, a well-known conservative operative who shuttled between Washington D.C. and South Dakota, was separate from the one lodged against Butina in Washington, D.C. Butina, a Russian national who cultivated relationships with powerful American conservative activists including Erickson, pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate laws prohibiting covert foreign agents. As part of her agreement she has promised to cooperate with American law enforcement. She was deported earlier this year after serving a short prison sentence to her native Russia where she received a hero’s welcome.Erickson became involved in relationship with Butina in 2013. As The Daily Beast previously reported, the duo dressed up as Rasputin to Butina’s flame-haired Empress Alexandra during a 2016 birthday party. The over-the-top gathering included an ice sculpture of a bottle imprinted with the Soviet hammer and sickle from which vodka flowed.The couple, who at one point lived together in South Dakota, had some kind of business together. The two were listed as the sole officers of Bridges LLC, a company registered in the state in February 2016, though it’s unclear what the company did or how it operated.Erickson was indicted in February on allegations that he ran a criminal scheme from 1996 to 2018 in which he was accused of using a chain of assisted living homes called Compass Care. Prosecutors alleged that Erickson also defrauded investors through a company called Investing with Dignity that claimed to be “in the business of developing a wheelchair that allowed people to go to the bathroom without being lifted out of the wheelchair.” The indictment says he also ran a fraudulent scheme that claimed to be building homes in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota.As first reported by The Daily Beast in July, several people have sued Erickson in California, Virginia, and South Dakota, claiming he misrepresented himself and his businesses and failed to pay investors back.The Daily Beast was first to unveil Erickson’s business scheme in North Dakota where he knowingly misled investors about owning a company there, according to a 2015 judgement filed in a California court. Two individuals who Erickson approached told The Daily Beast that he swindled them into investing in a land deal he had set up near Williston, North Dakota. Erickson told the two that he owned land there and would set up a transaction between two of his companies.One of the companies he represented while soliciting investments was Northern Plains Holdings, LLC, according to investors and people familiar with the deal. The North Dakota secretary of state’s office told The Daily Beast it did not have record of such a company connected to Erickson. In a complaint filed in a lawsuit in 2015, one of the investors alleged Erickson planned to use a company he controlled to sell undeveloped North Dakota land it owned to a second company Erickson controlled.In an email in November of 2013 to a potential investor for the Bakken deal, Erickson asked for funding for what he called his “new real estate development venture” in North Dakota. “I’m extremely proud of the work of our development team as together we find new ways to service the office and housing needs of this new American gold rush,” Erickson wrote. In the email, Erickson called his new business the “Bakken oil fields” and said it was set up to capitalize on the boom in North Dakota.“Due to your interest in my work and in consideration of past kindness, I would welcome your investment of any amount you choose (up to $100,000),” the email said. Erickson garnered at least $50,000 from the email exchange and did not pay any of it back, according to the judge’s decision on the 2015 case.— Pervaiz Shallwani contributed to this story.READ THIS LISTCoronavirusCheat SheetPoliticsEntertainmentMediaWorld NewsHalf FullCultureU.S. NewsScoutedTravelBeast InsideCrosswordNewslettersAboutContactTipsJobsHelpPrivacyCode of Ethics & StandardsTerms & ConditionsCopyright & TrademarkSitemapCoupons© 2020 The Daily Beast Company LLCAdvertise With Us

I Am IAS Officer, Do My Work Quickly: Man Calls Police Station, Gets Arrested For Fraud

2018-12-30T13:32:20+05:30




A man was arrested for allegedly impersonating an IAS officer to get work of his relatives and friends done, police said on Saturday.
Mani Tyagi, in his late 20s, had recently called up the Gautam Buddh Nagar (Rural) Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal and said that he is an IAS officer, pressuring him to get the work of an acquaintance done quickly, they said.
The officer said that he felt something was fishy, so he put the phone number on surveillance and it was tracked down to Ghaziabad. 
After a probe, the accused was arrested by a team from the Badalpur Police Station in Greater Noida, Jaiswal told reporters.
""At times he would say he is a district magistrate posted in Tripura and cite his batch and cadre to build pressure on police officials,"" he said.
Tyagi, a resident of Sahibabad in Ghaziabad and a BA graduate, claims to be working as a supervisor in a private company, but this is yet to be verified, the officer said.
Tyagi told reporters that he had used the name of an IAS officer, a distant relative of his, currently posted in Tripura.
""I have only done it a few times to help some people with their work, I have never taken money from anyone,"" Tyagi said and added that he had called up Jaisawal, officials in a sales tax office and Hazratganj Police Station in Lucknow.
Tyagi was booked for fraud and related offences and remanded in judicial custody, the police said.

and last updated 2017-10-02 18:57:35-04

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office started the investigation seven months ago after anonymous tips accused the last three chiefs of the Hernando Beach Volunteer Fire Department of misappropriations of funds. Since then, Hernando County has taken over the fire department in Hernando Beach. On Friday deputies arrested Travis Morris, David Freda, and David Murdock. All men were former fire chiefs at the Hernando Beach Volunteer Fire Department.Morris, a current FEMA employee was arrested at the Hernando County Emergency Operations Center. Morris is charged with a first degree felony of organized fraud of more than $50,000.Murdock, a current fire captain for the city of Brooksville is charged with a second degree felony of organized fraud of more than $20,000.Freda, a current fire chief for the city of Brooksville was arrested at a 7-eleven in Pasco County on Friday night. He is charged with organized fraud of more than $50,000.  Pasco County Sheriff's Office says they also arrested on an additional person, Anthony Bucaro, for attempting to help Freda flee from deputies. The Hernando County Sheriff’s office says it is not releasing details of the fraudulent charges because the investigation is ongoing. Freda and Murdock are currently on administrative leave from the city of Brooksville without pay.

In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Georgia-based Credit Nation, where Guess was an owner and vice president, for allegedly running a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme in life settlement contracts. A federal judge later placed Credit Nation in receivership.On Aug. 15, TSSB officials issued an emergency administrative order barring Guess from continuing to sell investments.At the time, they said, he was unlicensed and should have disclosed to investors that on Aug. 4, investigators had executed a search warrant at his office.Guess, in a document asking authorities to rescind the administrative order and the search warrant, wrote that he wasn't given the chance to respond before the search warrant was executed.He also contended that he was unfairly denied the opportunity to dispute allegations of wrongdoing before the TSSB issued its emergency order.In the document, Guess cited ""Mosaic law"" as a foundation for ""Commercial Law,"" which he wrote ""forms the underpinnings of Western Civilization.""Guess signed the affidavit as the ""affiant/real natural man,"" though it is unclear why.Meanwhile, investigators continued to build the criminal case.As of Tuesday afternoon, Guess was being held in Collin County jail on $500,000 bond, according to the jail's website.  If convicted, he faces a maximum of 99 years in prison, a TSSB spokesman said.The agency's enforcement attorneys will act as special prosecutors in the case, which is common in similar situations, the spokesman, Robert Elder, said Tuesday.Email IconJill Cowan.

Suspended Charleroi attorney Keith A. Bassi pleaded guilty Monday to charges stemming from allegations he stole more than $500,000 from an elderly client suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, and funneled some of it into the accounts of a Mon Valley newspaper.Federal prosecutors said Bassi, 61, stole money from a client identified in court records only as “N.J.L.” beginning in 2013. The victim was diagnosed with the illnesses and determined to be mentally incompetent early the previous year, according to a bill of information filed in the case.District Judge Arthur J. Schwab accepted guilty pleas from Bassi to three counts of felony mail fraud and set a sentencing hearing for March 14.
A cousin of N.J.L.’s who is seeking to become her guardian attended the hearing. He asked that neither he nor the victim, 85, be identified while the petition is pending in Orphan’s Court.“What can I say?” he said after Monday’s hearing. “It’s certainly despicable.”Bassi spoke in court only to answer Schwab’s questions about whether he understood his rights and understood his actions in entering the pleas.Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Melucci said Bassi took a total of roughly $505,000 from the client for his own use. That included putting $110,000 into accounts related to the Mon Valley Independent in Monessen, a newspaper he co-owns. Bassi told investigators who confronted him in May he was “motivated to use N.J.L.’s assets for himself” because of “financial issues,” Melucci told the judge.A power of attorney executed by N.J.L. gave Bassi permission to authorize the spending of money for her “material care, investments and compensation for services rendered,” the prosecution stated in the record. She has been in the dementia unit of a care facility since 2015 and has no close living family members.
N.J.L.’s cousin said in a letter to Schwab that relatives suspect Bassi may have been responsible for additional possessions of hers being “sold or given away or maybe even sent into trash somewhere.”The prosecution also said he used the woman’s money to pay premiums on a $1.2 million life insurance policy on himself, with death benefits going to a person identified only as B.B., who is not a defendant, according to the record signed by Acting U.S. Attorney Soo Song. In September 2016, Bassi filed a “surrender request” for the policy and received a check from the insurance company for $163,086, which he deposited into his money market account, prosecutors said.Bassi, who lives in Jefferson Township, Fayette County, hasn’t practiced law at Bassi, Vreeland and Associates, the Charleroi firm where he was formerly a partner, since June, the state Supreme Court said in August when it announced his suspension. The temporary suspension became effective Sept. 15, and there has been no further action by that court regarding Bassi’s status.The prosecution also said Bassi deposited $74,876 of the woman’s money into his personal checking account at CFS between November 2013 and May 2014. Another $136,473 was stolen from her in July 2016 and deposited into his savings account, the prosecution alleges. Bassi was previously listed as general counsel for CFS, also based in Charleroi.He also is accused of opening a money market account at a PNC branch in September 2016 with a deposit of $72,429 from the woman’s assets.Bassi has agreed to pay restitution as part of the plea deal. He is expected to forfeit $235,515 held in his PNC money market account. The federal government also will seek a judgment in an amount to be determined by the court to settle the case, the record shows.Stephen Stallings, Bassi’s attorney, said in court that he and the prosecution are still working out the exact amount of restitution Bassi owes because there is a “little bit of double counting” involving some of the money Bassi took from N.J.L.Stallings declined comment following Monday’s proceeding.

ByKARMA ALLENMay 1, 2017, 11:29 AM• 4 min readShare to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this article5:55Fyre Festival co-founder speaks out: Took a 'big risk' and failedBilly McFarland, who co-founded the Fyre Festival with rapper Ja Rule, blamed inclement weather for the event's failure and promised refunds and free tickets for next year's event.DylanACOP/Twitter— -- A $100 million proposed class-action lawsuit filed on Sunday accused the Fyre Festival and its organizers of fraud, alleging the music festival's ""lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees—suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions.""The suit, filed by Daniel Jung on behalf of himself and all festival attendees, claimed the festival, which was promoted as a supermodel-filled luxury concert event, was closer to ““The Hunger Games” or “Lord of the Flies” than Coachella.” It seeks damages ""in excess of"" $100 million.Multiple concertgoers said they were left stranded on the private island of Fyre Cay over the weekend after officials placed the event site on lockdown because, according to the tourism ministry, Fyre organizers had allegedly failed to pay customs duty taxes on items imported for the event.Ticket packages for the now-postponed event reportedly sold for between $4,000 to as as much as $100,000 per person, according to the suit and ticket purchasers.In a statement released on Sunday, Jung’s attorney, Mark Geragos, whose past clients include Michael Jackson and Chris Brown, said Fyre organizers ""need to step up and make this right but unfortunately, the opposite has occurred.""The suit slams organizers, claiming the festival ""was nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam from the very beginning"" and that they ""intended to fleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water—and without regard to what might happen to them after that.”The suit also alleges that concertgoers were left without money to pay for basic transportation, such as local taxis or buses because organizers told attendees to upload money to a wristband for use at the festival rather than bring any cash.Filed in the Central District of California, the suit asserts claims of fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith, and negligent misrepresentation.It names the festival’s creators --  rapper Ja Rule and tech entrepreneur Billy McFarland --  as well as the Delaware-based Fyre Media entity as defendants.The organizers did not immediately respond to ABC News's attempts to reach out for comment on the tourism ministry's statement and the lawsuit.Ja Rule, listed in the suit as Jeffery Atkins, released a statement via Twitter on Friday, saying he was ""heartbroken"" about that the event and ""was not a scam as everyone is reporting."" He also said that it was not his fault, but he is ""taking responsibility.""On Saturday, the organizers promised in a statement posted to the festival's website that ""all festival goers this year will be refunded in full. We will be working on refunds over the next few days and will be in touch directly with guests with more details.""The organizers said all guests from this year will have free VIP passes to next year’s festival, according to the statement. They said the 2018 festival will be held at “a United States beach venue.""ABC News' Joshua Hoyos contributed to this report.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesTrump challenges the vote and takes legal actionNov 05, 3:10 PMJudges want more evidence from Trump campaign as election cases get tossedNov 07, 4:01 AMBiden says 'we're going to win' as Trump falls behind in key statesNov 06, 11:07 PMEta to strengthen back into tropical storm Saturday, will approach Florida Sunday37 minutes agoWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows tests positive for COVID-191 minute agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Her arrest report says deputies started investigating in April, when the Tax Collector’s Office notice irregularities in a random audit. Video of Bush showed her apparently charging a customer too much and putting the cash difference in her purse. At that time, she was fired from the job, according to the arrest report.Deputies combed through records and have identified 593 customers so far believed to have been swindled by Bush, with her profiting $13,433.53. The arrest report says she admits to conducting the illegal transactions for years, using the money to fund her habit of cocaine and prescription pills. The Tax Collector’s Office says all of the involved customers will get a complete refund of anything Bush overcharged.Bush and her attorney met with the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office in June, where the arrest report says she made the same admissions as during prior interviews.Jail records show Bush was arrested Friday, just before 3 PM.The Tax Collector’s Office says Bush was a Customer Service Representative from December 2007 to April 2017, working both at the main office in St. Augustine and the Ponte Vedra branch.A statement from the Tax Collector’s Office says this incident prompted a complete review of procedures around monetary transactions. They have installed new measures, including regular audits, random drug screening, automated change machines, enhanced security surveillance and supervisor training.“I have been your Tax Collector the past 34 years, and never before has this happened under my watch. I realize people are fallible, and processes may be flawed, but I believe the measures we have implemented will significantly reduce the likelihood of this happening again. You have placed your trust in me, and I can be certain that we have learned from this, we are a stronger organization because of it, and will strive to maintain your faith in our services,” says the statement from Tax Collector Dennis Hollingsworth.Your browser does not support HTML5 audio.Listennewsweathertraffic41TrafficField AveIntermittent lane closures due to construction on Field Ave both ways from Pecan St to Jasmine Ave.Womans Club DrIntermittent lane closures due to construction on Womans Club Dr both ways between Orchid Ave and Fairway Dr.Jamie Dupree's Washington InsiderWhat did we learn from Election 2020?Latest National NewsIncreasingly normal: Guns seen outside vote-counting centersArmed men arrested near Philadelphia vote counting locationAdvocates race to find voters to correct flawed ballotsLatest News VideosBrittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor reveal sex of their baby‘Game of Thrones’ stars Rose Leslie and Kit Harington expecting first childMan accused of luring and kidnapping 11-year-old he met on Instagram

The U.S. Department of Justice has announced that Brian Brundage, the owner of two recycling businesses, has pleaded guilty to illegally landfilling potentially hazardous electronic scrap as part of a scheme to resell the materials and avoid paying income taxes.Brundage, who owned Chicago Heights, Illinois-based Intercon Solutions Inc. and Gary, Indiana-based EnviroGreen Processing LLC, which purported to recycle electronics on behalf of corporate and governmental clients, was, in reality, from 2005 to 2016, landfilling, stockpiling and reselling at a profit to companies who shipped the materials overseas, according to a plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago.Brundage also admitted to evading $743,984 in federal taxes by concealing the income he earned from reselling the e-scrap and paying himself funds that he falsely recorded as Intercon business expenses. Brundage pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, and one count of tax evasion, which is punishable by up to five years incarceration. Sentencing is slated for Feb. 27, 2019.According to the plea agreement, Brundage caused employees of Intercon and EnviroGreen to sell some of the e-scrap and other materials to vendors whom Brundage knew would ship the materials overseas. Some of the materials contained CRTs (cathode ray tubes), which contain leaded glass. Brundage admitted causing multiple tons of CRT glass and other potentially hazardous materials to be destroyed in environmentally unsafe ways and later landfilled.To read the plea agreement, click here.

International Recycling News




More than 100 people attended Erema North America’s second annual Discovery Day 2018 on Sept. 25 at its facility in Ipswich, Massachusetts. Erema and several other plastics and recycling industry experts presented trends and concerns with plastics recycling. “The thing about ‘Discovery Day’ is there is a lot to discover with [plastics recycling],” says Martin Baumann, vice president of sales at Erema North America. “Like some of the presentations said, what can be done with recycled materials? A lot of people view recycled materials as damaged goods. It doesn’t have to be that way. Hence, let’s discover what can be done—that’s the idea of the whole concept.” Erema invited recyclers, processors, resin suppliers, brand owners and other industry experts to its Discovery Day to hear about the state of plastics recycling and learn about innovations. The Discovery Day featured a number of speakers, including Manica Ulcnik-Krump, head of BU Recycled Resource, Intersoh Dienstleistungs GmbH, Germany; Clemens Kitzberger, business development manager application postconsumer at Erema, Austria; Michael Prochazka, head of Erema business unit Keycycle; Tamsin Ettefagh, vice president of Envision Plastics; Jeffrey Zhang, Vistamaxx market developer for ExxonMobil Chemical; and John Capece, sales manager at Erema North America.Baumann says Erema has been hosting Discovery Day events at its Austrian facility for years, but it recently started hosting the event at its U.S.-based Ipswich facility after that office expanded its test center about two years ago. He adds that interest for the event seemed to grow this year, as well, almost doubling in attendance. He says plastics recycling is a topic of growing interest for many in recycling.“Fundamentally, I think we’re going to enter the golden age of plastics recycling,” he says. “But it’s not going to happen overnight. So, we have to build consistence behind technology. The good news is the ability to make technology to actually recycle exists. The bad news is in certain countries like in the U.S., we really like the overall infrastructure and need to do a lot of investment to create quality products. That’s not going to happen overnight. But generally speaking, interest is there.”Plastics recycling trendsDuring Discovery Day, presenters noted a number of concerns and trends in plastics recycling. Manica Ulcnik-Krump of BU Recycled Resource shared a few numbers related to plastics recycling worldwide. She said in 2016, world plastics production totaled around 335 million metric tons and about half of annual plastic production was destined for single-use products. In addition, there are more than 1 million plastic bottles bought per minute in total, and only 23 percent of those bottles are recycled in the U.S. Also, about 4 trillion plastic bags are used worldwide each year, yet only 1 percent of them are returned for recycling. To date, the European Union produces about 26 million tons of plastics waste per year. However, Ulcnik-Krump said about 28 percent of this plastics waste is being recycled while 32 percent is being landfilled in the European Union. “We do have a problem,” Ulcnik-Krump said. “Talking about pollution in the oceans is terrible, but it’s more terrible that we’re landfilling so much material that might easily be used. The European economy is losing [about] 8 billion euros per year in potential value by failing to divert plastic wastes from landfills and returning them to the production process.”Clemens Kitzberger of Erema highlighted some of the trends regarding postconsumer recycling. He reported that, in general, postconsumer recycling hasn’t changed much in the past two years.“One year ago at Discovery Day, I spoke on postconsumer recycling and nothing has changed, except the China ban is active now,” he said. “But in film recycling, not too much has changed.”He reported that about 6.5 billion pounds of film are used each year in the U.S., and most of this (if not all of this) is being sent to landfills. He said film waste is currently not accepted by U.S. material recovery facilities (MRFs). However, Kitzberger said a large U.S. company performed a test on film recycling—it collected curbside film in the U.S. and sent it to an Erema facility in Europe to be pelletized and treated. Additives can be added in this process to ensure a better end product as well. He said the end products were pellets, which could be used to make other products such as shopping bags or bottles.Kitzberger noted that there could be opportunities to recycle film plastics in the future—provided communities don’t implement plastic bag bans and the use of film plastics.“If we, as a plastic industry, don’t work on this topic, politics will,” Kitzberger said. “If they do it, it’s not the best interest for us. We’re the specialists. We have to show them how to make the plastic, how to make circular economy possible. If not, it will get lost and harder for all of us.” In addition, Jeffrey Zhang, Vistamaxx market developer at ExxonMobil Chemical, discussed how compatibilizers can be used to enhance the quality of mixed material streams and make plastics recycling more effective. He notes that his company’s Vistamaxx performance polymers enhance the recyclability of low-quality polyethylene. Equipment capabilitiesErema also highlighted some of its equipment at the event. The company focused on its RegrindPro, which debuted about five years ago. The company says it has put about 40 RegrindPro plants into operation since 2015, and it expects there to be a total of 60 of these plants in operation by the end of 2018.Erema concluded its event with a demo of its RegrindPro. The company first showed how the RegrindPro processes HDPE, and then it showed how it processes film plastics. “That machine is optimized for rigid materials like HDPE bottles,” Baumann says. “What we [did at Discovery Day] for a test is showing what is possible by also processing [film plastics], but it is not optimized for that.”

UL has announced a certification for companies to measure and report circular economy aspects of products, sites and organizations. UL 3600 will be the first standard to evaluate a company’s circularity of material flows, UL reports.""UL is pleased to introduce the world's first certification to measure a company's circular economy initiatives,"" says Alberto Uggetti, vice president and general manager for UL's environment division.Circular economy is widely seen as an important aspect of company sustainability efforts.The certification will measure circularity progress in light of global trends, including climate change, resource constraints and bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals.""Global issues such as supply chain constraints, recent restrictions on recycling imports and resource scarcity are pushing circular economy thinking to the forefront for many companies, and UL offers a way to track and measure progress on these initiatives and communicate them to the marketplace in a transparent way,” Uggetti says.The certification is the foundation of UL's Circularity Facts Program, which evaluates a company's efforts to move from a linear economy mindset to a more sustainable, circular approach that eliminates waste and keeps materials in productive use longer.Through the program, UL can report the use of recycled content, bio-based content, recyclability, waste minimization and zero waste to landfill, among other aspects.UL 3600 will evaluate companies’ material flows across three dimensions: product, facility and enterprise. The certification will show a company’s current circularity efforts and growth and can be used to improve a company’s understanding of the impact of material flows.William Hoffman III, UL senior scientist and author of the UL 3600 Standard, will speak on the topic during VERGE 18 conference on Oct. 17 in Oakland, California.

Municipal / IC&I

Paper

Plastics




The National League of Cities (NLC) released a new report ""Rethinking Recycling: How Cities Can Adapt to Evolving Markets,"" which analyzes how city leaders can develop resilient local waste management systems in response to China’s new regulations. The report marks the beginning of a larger effort to examine sustainability in solid waste management and is the first piece of literature to highlight how municipalities can benefit from China’s upcoming ban. “In the face of adversity, city leaders have historically been our nation’s problem-solvers,” says Clarence Anthony, CEO and executive director of NLC. “China’s new policy is a wake-up call that we need to think more critically about waste management and cities now have the opportunity to strengthen domestic markets and chart a sustainable path forward.” Historically, Chinese demand for materials to feed its manufacturing led it to purchase recyclables from all over the world. The rest of the industry relied on these sales to fund their collection operations. China’s new policy, National Sword, upends this approach, the NLC says.  Phase one institutes a ban specifically on mixed paper and plastics. By 2020, the second phase will ban all solid waste imports. This change could potentially diminish markets, cause market fluctuations and reversals and lower revenues, according to the report. The U.S. exported 16 million tons of recycling commodities to China per year before the ban. In 2016, these shipments were worth $5.2 billion. Many Americans recognize the importance of recycling to fight climate change, reduce pollution and limit municipal landfill costs. The recycling industry also accounts for 757,000 stable jobs, $36.6 billion in wages and $6.7 billion in state, local and federal tax revenues, the report says. In addition, oceanic plastic contamination has come to the fore as a major international crisis. Inefficient waste management practices have led to 8 million metric tons of plastic being dumped in the oceans annually.  Durango and Fort Collins, Colorado, and Washington are a few cities using partnerships and educational campaigns to increase recycling rates and maintain local control over waste management systems. Long-term recommendations for city leaders from the report include:Conduct an economic analysis of your current management operations.Work with contractors.Ensure fees and rates reflect current costs.Evaluate local policies and economic incentives.Explore local and unconventional markets.Consider streams.Examine asset ownership and consider infrastructure investments. Read the full report here.

Credit, debit cardholders were tricked into sharing details



Four men were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly running a cyber fraud racket, the police said on Wednesday.The police said that the men used to trick credit and debit cardholders into sharing their card details and password after offering them their services to redeem cash against reward points earned by them on their cards. The fraudulently obtained details were further used for shopping and illegal money transactions, the police said. Sujit Singh, 22, a former employee of an online food order and delivery company, Rishabh Saxena, 19, a BCA degree holder, Pankaj, 29, who earlier worked as a contractual employee in the credit card section of a bank, and Rakesh Kumar, 35, an accountant working at a petrol pump were arrested.“Twelve cell phones, six debit cards and 17 SIM cards issued on fake documents were seized from the arrested persons,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Nupur Prasad.‘Bank executive’Ms. Prasad said the arrests came following investigation into a case filed on March 26, on the complaint of Rocky, who lost ₹60,000 after sharing his credit card details to a person over the phone. The person had introduced himself as an executive from the bank’s credit card department.Rocky told the police that he was not suspicious as the caller had introduced himself as an executive from the bank’s credit card department and he knew the last four digits of the victim’s credit card. The caller told Rocky that his card had 20,000 reward points worth ₹10,000, which he can redeem before the offer expires in a few hours.“As Rocky agreed, he received three one-time password (OTPs) on his cell phone number and the caller tricked him into sharing the OTPs with him. Within seconds he received three messages regarding withdrawal of ₹60,000 in three transactions from his account,” said the DCP.Virtual walletsDuring investigation, the police learnt that the withdrawn money was transferred to various virtual wallets. They also learnt that the virtual money was encashed at a petrol pump. Investigators obtained details of the wallet holders and identified the real beneficiary of the cheated money as Rakesh Kumar.“We arrested Kumar and his interrogation led to the arrest of his three accomplices,” said Ms. Prasad, adding that two more suspects — Vikas and Pawan — are still absconding.The police said that each of the accused had a different task to perform.

Founder of former Falmouth mortgage company pleads guilty to fraud

Robert Pena conspired to divert about $2.5M from government agency.
BOSTON — The president and founder of a now-defunct East Falmouth mortgage company pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges that he defrauded the federal government out of about $2.5 million, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz’s office.Robert Pena, 68, of Falmouth, who founded Mortgage Security Inc., pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and six counts of wire fraud. U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf scheduled sentencing for Jan. 5.Beginning in 2011, Pena defrauded the Government National Mortgage Association, also known as Ginnie Mae, the government-run corporation that makes housing more affordable by injecting capital into the U.S. housing market, the statement says.Pena deposited loan-payoff checks into bank accounts unknown to Ginnie Mae and then used that money for personal and business expenses, according to Ortiz’s office. Pena also diverted borrowers’ escrow funds and mortgage-insurance premiums for his own use. Pena took about $2.5 million, which Ginnie Mae then had to pay to the investors whose investments it had guaranteed.Pena also tried to cover up his scheme by providing false reports to Ginnie Mae about the status of the loans Mortgage Security Inc. was servicing, according to the statement.The state Division of Banks had issued a temporary cease-and-desist order against the East Falmouth mortgage company in 2013, banning it from doing business with Massachusetts customers.Pena was arrested in August 2016, but his company was first investigated by the state in 2009. The Division of Banks filed a complaint making several charges, including failure to properly maintain books and records and failure to file required reports in a timely fashion. The company contested some of those charges, and after a hearing a consent order was issued.In April 2013 another investigation was spurred by consumer complaints, and the state reported that “Mortgage Security has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant a determination that it will operate honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest, as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.”Pena faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss.— Follow Haven Orecchio-Egresitz on Twitter: @HavenCCT.

 	A North Carolina attorney and real estate developer is facing a maximum sentence of 30 years after pleading guilty to bank fraud charges relating to a mortgage fraud scheme that is anticipated to cost various lenders, title insurers and investors at least $18 million.
 	According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Joseph Kinlaw, 63, pled guilty this week to charges stemming from a scheme that saw Kinlaw allegedly falsified property information in order to obtain several loans from BB&T and First Citizens Bank under the auspices of developing residential real estate near Camp Lejeune, a Marine Corps base in North Carolina.
 	In a release, the U.S. Attorney’s Office stated that Kinlaw was a licensed North Carolina attorney who operated various alleged real estate investment and development entities on behalf of investors.
 	According to the release, Kinlaw used those entities to obtain fraudulent loans from BB&T and First Citizens Bank, between January 2011 and April 2013.
 	The U.S. Attorney’s Office stated that Kinlaw allegedly used the real estate development entities to defraud BB&T and First Citizens Bank by falsifying the legal descriptions of the loan collateral, and by falsifying releases of the collateral. 
 	According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Kinlaw was then able to use the collateral for other real estate investment activities and loans. Also, by fraudulently releasing the banks’ collateral before the banks’ loans had been satisfied, Kinlaw was able to convey the collateral to third parties for value and continue the scheme.
 	In order to keep the scheme alive and to keep from being discovered, Kinlaw allegedly used outside funds – money that was unrelated to the real estate development activity that was the subject of each loan – to make ongoing loan interest payments to BB&T and First Citizens Bank. 
 	In some cases, Kinlaw allegedly used loan proceeds from one transaction to make loan interest payments on another transaction. And in other instances, Kinlaw fraudulently extracted funds from other investors and their business interests to make payments on the loans, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
 	Eventually, banks stopped loaning money to Kinlaw, his related companies and investors.  As a result of that, the existing loans went into default. 
 	And because Kinlaw substituted false legal descriptions of bank collateral, and fraudulently conveyed bank collateral, BB&T and First Citizens Bank were unable to recover their loan losses in foreclosure, the U.S. Attorney’s Office stated. 
 	Additionally, various title insurance companies and investors also lost “substantial funds” because of the scheme, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
 	Overall, the full loss suffered by the banks, investors, title companies and other companies is still under investigation, but the losses are presently anticipated to exceed $18 million, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
 	For his crimes, Kinlaw faces up to 30 years in prison and 5 years of supervised release. He also faces a fine of up to $1 million, and an order of restitution to victims.

Fishman said Rostyslaw Mykytyn was indicted on June 19 on five counts of wire fraud. He was scheduled to make his initial appearance Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge James B. Clark III here.According to the indictment, Mykytyn was the owner, president and chief executive officer of RGM Management Co., doing business as Campbell Co. Inc. in Washington State.The company provided sales representative services to a company that manufactured and distributed power and cooling infrastructures for large computer spaces. Mykytyn allegedly solicited various investors for Campbell based upon false and fraudulent financial statements.He allegedly created fake commission statements from a client that showed sales of more than $4 million, of which Campbell was due $472,720, to make the company's income appear greater than it was.Mykytyn also allegedly falsely represented Campbell's assets to investors who, based on those representations, wire transferred $1.5 million into the company. Mykytyn allegedly would then divert a portion of the investment to himself to pay for his personal expenses, without disclosing the diversion to his investors.If convicted, each count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.Staff Writer Suzanne Russell: 732-565-7335; srussell@mycentraljersey.comAbout Us Corrections Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.mycentraljersey.com.

Creek County Funeral Director Arrested On Allegations Of Fraud

Creek County Funeral Director Arrested On Allegations Of Fraud






















Emory Bryan, News On 6 CREEK COUNTY -- A Creek County Funeral director has been arrested for fraud. He's accusing of spending money that was supposed to be in the bank, for ""pre-need"" funeral arrangements. The arrest came Wednesday after a couple of years of questions and auditing for a funeral home and cemetery operator who authorities say lost the money through poor investments. Read the affidavit regarding the allegations against Schumacher Ron Schumacher is behind bars in Creek County for embezzlement and fraud over allegations he took prepaid funeral money and spent it to prop up his failing business. ""And when you find out you've paid money over the years and it's not there, that's a problem,"" John Doak, Insurance Commissioner, said. Schumacher owned two funeral homes, one in Bristow and one in Depew. A state audit determined his pre-paid trust account was $100,000 short. Read the charges against Schumacher Schumacher came up with most of the money, but faces embezzlement charges for emptying accounts containing money that was supposed to go towards funerals. ""We take matters like this very seriously because the trust of the funeral industry is a foundation because so much of what funeral directors do is done without being able to be seen by the public,"" Mark Riley, Oklahoma Funeral Board, said. It's a new effort between the Funeral Board and Insurance Commission to root out fraud. ""He will go to court and hopefully we can get restitution for families who have apparently lost their money,"" Randy Brogdon, Deputy Insurance Commissioner, said. ""They put money in trust and it's no longer there."" Schumacher has denied wrongdoing, but is now without a license to operate while he faces felony charges.

		Former owner of Braking Point in Austintown pleads guilty in fraud case	

Local News


Ryan Sheridan's sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 23, 2020


by: WKBN Staff
		
					Posted: Oct 4, 2019 / 05:27 PM EDT
 / Updated: Oct 4, 2019 / 09:48 PM EDT 












(WKBN) – The former owner of a drug treatment center in Austintown has pleaded guilty to several charges in a health care fraud case surrounding the center.
Ryan Sheridan entered a guilty plea on Friday, without a plea agreement.
His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 23, 2020.
Sheridan will not be released on bond.
 Related Content       3 defendants in Braking Point fraud case plead guilty         Former Braking Point owner back behind bars       
The other defendants — Dr. Thomas Bailey, Dr. Arthur Smith, Kortney Gherardi, Lisa Pertee and Sheridan’s ex-wife, Jennifer — also pleaded guilty to their roles in the case.
Prosecutors said Braking Point billed Medicaid $48 million for services that weren’t provided, weren’t medically necessary, lacked proper documentation or had other issues that made them ineligible for reimbursement.
Investigators said the group developed a “standard protocol” for giving the same amount of Suboxone, a medication used to treat addiction, to every patient who came in for treatment. These patients were not evaluated by a properly licensed doctor first to determine if Suboxone was medically necessary, according to investigators.
“These defendants stole tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers through fraudulent billing and other crimes,” said U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman. “They used the drug epidemic plaguing Ohio as a way to line their pockets and profited off the suffering of others.”
“The victim here isn’t just the healthcare system, it’s the people struggling with addiction who needed a beacon of hope but instead found themselves at the center of a shady scheme,” said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.
All six defendants will be sentenced in January.

The investigation revealed that some of the drugs originated from Mexico, Alanis said.The investigation was conducted by DPS; the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, El Paso Division; the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office; the El Paso Police Department; the U.S. Department of Justice's West Texas High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area; Homeland Security Investigation; U.S. Border Patrol; and members of the 34th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.More:El Paso narcotics officers arrest man, woman after vehicle flees from police“This investigation primarily focused on dangerous drugs and felony charges including engaging in organized criminal activity, manufacturing and delivering of controlled substances, and possession of controlled substances,” Alanis said. “These serious crimes are not only multidimensional, but more importantly have a direct relationship to the nation’s opioid epidemic problem.”He added, “In an effort to effectively combat the diversion and abuse of prescription fraud in our major cities, a multifaceted approach and seamless coordination of effort across jurisdiction is necessary.”The 18 people, all from El Paso, arrested were:Leticia Cervantes, 60Mauricio Cervantes, 43Cynthia Molinar, 37Guadalupe Nuno, 66Margaret Ziashkau, 45Maria Porras, 60Myrna Dattoli, 43Diana Gonzalez, 35Gracie Castillo, 45Nicholas Castillo, 47Rosa Castillo, 76Mario Martinez, 22Maria Garcia, 58Guadalupe Zamarripa, 70Debra Drost, 33Luis Iglesias, 49Alfonso Gil III, 38Rogelio Salas, 32Common prescription frauds include legitimate prescription pads being stolen from physicians' offices and prescriptions written for fictitious patients, suspects altering the physician's prescription, and other methods to falsify legal means of obtaining drugs, according to the DEA's website.DEA El Paso Division Special Agent in Charge Kyle W. Williamson said opioids and other prescription drugs were abused by more than 11.5 million people in 2016.More:El Paso's Most Wanted fugitives for the week of Sept. 9, 2018Last year, 77,000 people died in the U.S. from drug overdose — an average of 177 to 200 people a day, he added.“Prescription drug abuse has been the fastest growing drug problem in the United States,” Williamson said. “Nearly a decade ago, U.S. gun deaths outnumbered opioid-related deaths by more than 5 to 1. Today drug overdoses suffered by our communities is the leading cause of injuries and death in the United States. Eclipsing deaths from motor vehicle crashes and firearms.”He added, “With abuse, controlled prescription drugs can be just as dangerous as addictive street drugs such as heroin. The fact of the matter is that prescription drug abuse destroys lives. That is why it is important that we address this problem by all available means, including the enforcement of our drug laws.”El Paso is not seeing a large number of drug overdoses due to prescription fraud, Williamson said. Statistics on the number of overdose deaths in El Paso were not immediately available.More:El Paso police arrest 3 people at East Side hotel on drug chargesThe investigation in El Paso is part of preventative actions being taken by the law enforcement agencies.“We are not seeing that level of abuse here in El Paso,” Williamson said. “El Paso hasn’t been impacted like other areas of the United States and that is where we are very fortunate. That is why we are taking a very aggressive approach to really stop the problem before it begins.”Aaron Martinez may be reached at 546-6249; aamartinez@elpasotimes.com; @AMartinez31 on Twitter.About Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.elpasotimes.com.

                   Alpha OmegaRaman Handa, former owner of Alpha Omega Jewelry.(Company image)The former owner of Boston-area Alpha Omega Jewelry -- who once counted Bill Clinton and Ben Affleck among his customers -- was arrested in Los Angeles on Tuesday after nearly a decade on the lam.Federal agents were waiting at Los Angeles International Airport to intercept Raman Handa, 67, a former Lexington resident, after his disembarked off his flight from India.Unsealed Wednesday, a 2011 indictment accuses Handa of 12 counts of wire fraud, which allegedly cost his bank lenders millions.According to the Department of Justice, the high-end jewelry company began experiencing ""severe financial troubles"" in 2007 and ""had difficulty keeping current"" on loans"" with several banks.""As part of the scheme to defraud Alpha Omega's lenders and in order to obtain additional loans, Handa allegedly fabricated inventory on reports that were submitted to the banks,"" a Justice Department press release on the arrest read. ""These reports were used by the banks to calculate the credit limit for Alpha Omega, and included inventory such as luxury watches and high-end items from Indian jewelry vendors, that Alpha Omega never in fact possessed.""Handa and his family abruptly left the country for India in late 2007, prompting lenders to take control of Alpha Omega. A subsequent review of the company's inventory allegedly found more than $7 million in unaccounted for or missing inventory. The business opened its initial location in Harvard Square in 1980, according to The Boston Globe, and later expanded with new locations inside Boston's Prudential Center and shopping malls in Burlington and Natick. Handa will appear in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Friday. His first court date in Boston has yet to be scheduled. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our   User Agreement,  Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,  and Your California Privacy Rights  (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.

North Las Vegas woman pleads guilty to insurance fraud






By:
KTNV Staff



Posted at 4:23 PM, Jun 22, 2016 
and last updated 2016-06-22 19:24:08-04


	Nevada Attorney General Adam Paul Laxalt announced that Nancy Ramirez Lozano, also known as Nancy Ramirez Montelongo, 42, of North Las Vegas, pleaded guilty to one count of insurance fraud.

	 

	The fraud was committed between October and November 2013. 

	 

	Lozano initiated a claim under a State Farm insurance policy in which she fraudulently represented that her motor vehicle had been stolen while parked in front of her brother’s residence in Las Vegas.

	 

	Lozano did so knowing that her motor vehicle had been parked in Stockton, California in a damaged condition on the day of the alleged theft. As a result of Lozano’s fraud, insurance benefits were paid on her behalf.

	 

	Insurance fraud is punishable by up to four years of imprisonment and a fine of no more than $5,000.

	 

	The sentencing hearing for Lozano is scheduled for October 17, 2016 in the Eighth Judicial District Court.

A former Victoria Housing Authority commissioner is charged with stealing from the government for more than 15 years.An indictment naming Raquel Garcia, 37, was unsealed Monday in the federal court in Corpus Christi.She was arrested Thursday.Federal prosecutors allege Garcia received nearly $175,000 in rent reductions she was not entitled to from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD.She is also accused of fraudulently receiving nearly $110,000 in income from the Social Security Administration for her son and herself.Garcia was living at an apartment on Fillmore Street from 1998 until last July and hid that her husband was living with her and his income, according to court documents.Garcia was on the Victoria Housing Authority board for two consecutive two-year terms from 2006 to 2010.HUD requires a resident to be on every housing authority's board of commissioners that are allowed to serve two, two-year terms, Victoria Housing Authority Director Debbie Gillespie said.""We unfortunately don't have tenants who want to participate in the resident advisory board, so we kind of pulled staff to come up with a model tenant to turn in a name to the mayor to be appointed to that position,"" Gillespie said. ""That's how she served on our board of commissioners.""The other board members are selected by and appointed by the mayor, she said.""She was a model renter at the time. ... We also have two Victoria County Sheriff's Office deputies on our staff that we get recommendations from as well because they are the ones out working with our tenants,"" Gillespie said.Garcia was living in one of the 321 public housing apartments in Victoria, where each person's rent depends on their total family composition and income.A family of one must make between $11,400 or $30,350 a year to qualify for public housing while a family of two must make between $13,000 and $34,700 to qualify.The Housing Authority has apartments on Crestwood Drive, Fillmore Street, Lova Drive, Cameron Street, South Depot Street, East Street and Leary Lane, Gillespie said.The Housing Authority runs a criminal background check, a sex offender background check and a credit history report on prospective tenants.In its rules, the Housing Authority requires tenants to notify it of any change in the number of apartment occupants within 10 days or face eviction.The Victoria Housing Authority opened in 1950, she said.A sheriff's deputy started the investigation on Garcia, but Gillespie declined to go into detail about what made him notice things were awry.When contacted Monday afternoon, Bill Ruddock, who is on the Victoria Housing Authority's board of commissioners, said he has worked with Garcia before but declined to comment further.If convicted, Garcia faces up to 10 years in federal prison for the one count of theft of HUD government funds and up to five years on each of the two SSA fraud charges. All charges also carry a possible $250,000 fine.Garcia appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington in Corpus Christi on Monday afternoon, where she requested appointed counsel.Her bond was set at $20,000, and she is scheduled to be arraigned at 9 a.m. Thursday.The Office of Inspector General for HUD and the Social Security Administration investigated.Assistant United States attorneys Jeffrey D. Preston and Hugo R. Martinez are prosecuting the case.

20 in South Texas Plead Guilty to Insurance Fraud

Federal authorities say 20 South Texas residents have been convicted for their roles in a scheme to defraud the American Family Life Assurance Co.
In mid-June, 36 people were indicted on accusations they participated in the scheme designed to defraud Columbus, Ga.-based AFLAC millions of dollars by filing false claims, the Associated Press reported.




According to the indictments, the defendants include a local police officer, county employees and school teachers. They purchased policies under the AFLAC Accident-Only Insurance Plan from several area insurance agents at various times beginning in July 2001 through April 2010. Under the plan, a policyholder could file a claim with AFLAC and obtain a cash benefit if he or she received treatment from a physician for a legitimate, accident-caused injury including lacerations, bruises, burns, fractures or dismemberment.
The Justice Department says on behalf of the defendants two Reynosa, Mexico, doctors filed minor injury claims thought too small to draw suspicion. In return, the border-city doctors received small kickbacks.
The physicians allegedly prepared an “accident report” for each fake injury in exchange for a cash kickback of approximately $15 per accident report, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas. In each report, the indictment alleges the physicians falsely claimed they had provided treatment and prescribed medication for the purported injury. In addition, the physicians and defendants allegedly attempted to conceal their scheme in numerous ways including agreeing to use injuries such as lacerations and minor burns as opposed to more serious injuries that paid higher cash benefits and could potentially attract a greater level of scrutiny by AFLAC’s claims department.
Over time, the defendants — many of whom allegedly recruited one another to purchase policies and join the alleged scheme — submitted approximately 21,600 allegedly false and fraudulent insurance claims, each accompanied by the physicians’ accident reports, to AFLAC’s claims department in Columbus, Ga. Based on the claims, AFLAC disbursed a total of approximately $3 million in insurance proceeds to the defendants.
So far, 20 defendants pleaded guilty to wire fraud. All 20 face a possible maximum of sentence of 20 years in federal prison without parole and a $250,000 fine.
Federal investigators dubbed the case “Operation Sitting Duck,” a play on the insurer’s feathered mascot.

BOSTON — A Milton man was arrested and appeared in federal court in Boston on Tuesday after he was accused of helping to steal more than $340,000 from a victim's bank account.A criminal complaint filed by the F.B.I. charges Fesnel Lafortune, 30, with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.The complaint said an unindicted co-conspirator obtained two checks for the stolen money from a Santander Bank in Boston in April 2017. Lafortune deposited one of the checks in the amount of $175,500 to a business bank account he had opened using the name, date of birth and Social Security number of a second victim, according to federal prosecutors.The compliant accused Lafortune of later withdrawing almost $30,000 from the fraudulent business account from three banks located in Boston, Quincy and Braintree.Lafortune is due back in court Monday for a detention hearing.

Home health care worker accused of fraud, advocates call out larger problem











June 11, 2019 06:32 PM Fraud investigators with the Minnesota Attorney General's Office say a woman providing in-home services as a Personal Care Assistant (PCA) repeatedly billed the Medicaid program for work she never performed, costing state taxpayers nearly $10,000.
Court records reviewed by 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reveal Kenya Gordon, 34, of New Hope is accused of working a second job while still logging hours as a PCA in the home of an unidentified couple in 2014 and 2015.

According to a probable cause statement filed by the Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Unit, Gordon ""submitted over 200 instances of overlapping claims"" between her work under PCA provider, A Caring Company, Inc. and Coram Healthcare.
In one quarter of a year, investigators say Gordon exceeded 1300 hours at both jobs. That would have required her to work more than 14 hours a day, every day, for three months.
A Caring Company, which is not accused of any crime, declined requests for an on-camera interview, but told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS it has paid back all unauthorized money to the state and that Gordon is no longer associated with the agency.
""We had no idea that this person was working another job at the same time,"" said owner Cheri Bielke.
Bielke also said Gordon and her clients both came to her agency under the PCA Choice program which allows clients to select their own caregivers.
Gordon, who is scheduled to go to trial in July, did not answer at the address listed for her in court documents and her attorney did not return calls for comment.

Executive director of the Minnesota Home Care Association, Kathy Messerli called any allegations of fraud ""very troubling,"" but she and others also point to what they say is a larger problem facing the state – a shortage of qualified PCA's.
""We really are facing a crisis as far as serving people in their homes. There just aren't enough people,"" Messerli said.
The association, whose members include PCA providers, says about 43,000 people in Minnesota use PCA services in their homes. It cites a rising demand for services, low wages for PCA's, and insufficient reimbursement from the state for the problems many agencies have filling open positions.
""There's a high level of responsibility for a very low wage, so it's hard to recruit people to do those jobs when they can take on another job for the same wage or higher and have less responsibility,"" Messerli said. ""We have clients out there waiting for services. They simply can't get the care they need.""
The Minnesota Department of Human Services declined an interview request from 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS, but DHS provided the following statistics:

As of July 2018, 153,611 people were enrolled as PCAs in Minnesota Health Care Programs. Of those, 43,080 actually provided services during fiscal year 2018. 
Individual PCAs must also meet provider standards by enrolling as a Minnesota Health Care Programs provider, passing a criminal background study and satisfactorily completing required online training.
PCA services must be supervised by a qualified professional as defined in state statute.

Messerli says recent legislation authorized funding for the state to move forward with implementing the federally mandated Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) program to try to cut down on fraud and better document the services clients receive.

Veteran accused of defrauding non-profits pleads no contest in Virginia Beach

Virginia Beach, Va. -  A veteran arrested for fraud earlier this year pleaded no contest at a hearing Tuesday morning in Virginia Beach Circuit Court and said he had no comment about the fraud charge.
Brent Henry was arrested in April and charged with Obtaining Money Under False Pretenses after Adam Mayo, the founder of Wags for Warriors, complained that Henry was scamming his non-profit organization.
Wags for Warriors works to train service dogs for veterans with PTSD.
Mayo said Henry told him he was involved in a helicopter crash in 2008 which resulted in his PTSD.
NewsChannel 3 investigated Henry’s military background and found that some of his claims didn’t match up.
Brent Henry
Records from the Marine Corps show he did serve from 1994 until 2000, but also show a bad conduct discharge. That came from a special court martial in 1998. He was accused of unauthorized absence and was demoted to private.
Records also show Henry was not serving in 2008, which is the year he claims to have been in a helicopter crash resulting in his PTSD.
Since November, leaders with Wags for Warriors said they have been working with Henry, raising money to help him pay for medical expenses and by providing hours of training for Henry’s dog, Geneva.
Tuesday in court we learned more about the money and resources that were taken.
The stipulations of facts was provided to us from the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office.
It states Wags For Warriors  paid $800 to help Henry with medical treatment for PTSD and paid another $2,400 worth of resources were used to train his service dog that he said he needed for the PTSD.
Records state they paid $450 for a vet bill for the dog.
Mayo said, “I forgive him for what he has done but I won’t trust him again and I won’t allow him around any of my guys in this program.”
Henry was also charged with two counts of fraud in Chesapeake after the non-profit organization Wounded Wear also filed a complaint.
In August, one of those charges was dismissed while Henry pleaded guilty to the other. He was sentenced to a three year suspended sentence and ordered to pay $400 restitution.
Henry will be sentenced in Virginia Beach on January 11, 2016.

		Man accused of pirating, selling videos faces new mail fraud charge

 The Margaret Chase Smith Federal Building



The man accused of illegally copying and selling pirated movies for years faces more prison time after he was indicted Wednesday on an additional charge of mail fraud.
Douglas Gordon, 51, who previously lived in Brewer but now resides in Mattawamkeag, is scheduled to be arraigned April 29 in U.S. District Court in Bangor.
In January, Gordon pleaded not guilty to two counts of copyright infringement in 2014 and 2016. He remains free on $2,500 unsecured bail that includes limited access to the internet as a condition.



Since his first court appearance, five film companies have been named as victims in court documents. They include Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., Mercury Pictures and the Walt Disney Co.
The mail fraud charge alleges that between April 2014 and January 2019 mailed copies of DVDs to purchasers who believed they were purchasing authentic motion picture DVDs of good quality. The copies Gordon sold and mailed were of inferior quality, the indictment said.
Between October 2010 and December 2016, Gordon and the operators of the websites on which he marketed the DVDs allegedly earned more than $588,000. Last year, Gordon allegedly earned $45,000 from the sale of counterfeit movies

The federal statute of limitations prevents Gordon from being charged with crimes that allegedly occurred before Jan. 21, 2014.
U.S. Homeland Security Investigations warned Gordon in 2015 and again in 2017 to cease his alleged illegal activities, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court. But, according to the U.S. attorney’s office, Gordon ignored those warnings, and between 2015 and January 2019 continued “unlawfully reproducing and selling tens of thousands of counterfeit copies of copyright-protected motion pictures.”
Gordon’s attorney Stephen Smith of Bangor said Friday that he is evaluating the evidence and anticipates going to trial this year.





“Doug is a longtime downtown [Bangor] business owner who helped revitalize the downtown before such efforts became cool,” Smith said.
Gordon owned Edge Video with locations in Bangor and Brewer. Both have closed.
If convicted, Gordon faces up to 20 years in federal prison on the mail fraud charge and up to three years in federal prison on the copyright infringement counts. He also could be fined up to $250,000 and be ordered to pay restitution if convicted.

With her trial date looming only a week away, Darlene Aurelia Bishop pleaded guilty in a wire fraud scheme she was charged with in federal court.


Bishop, 40, was accused of falsifying bank documents to certify that individuals had tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars – which didn’t exist – in their bank accounts. Bishop was reportedly paid millions for her role in the scheme.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Austin Berry prosecuted the case.
According to the plea agreement, Bishop pleaded guilty to count one of the indictment, conspiracy to commit wire fraud. As part of the agreement, she will face up to 20 years in federal prison, up to three years supervised release after the sentence and a fine up to $250,000.
Bishop also forfeited $579,766.05 from the sale of her home, two Lincoln Navigators, a Kia Spectra and a Chevrolet Corvette, and was ordered to pay $5,854,701, or the proceeds she gained from the scheme.
She was also charged with eight counts of wire fraud and six counts of money laundering in connection with two properties and four vehicles, all of which were dismissed with the agreement.
Bishop admitted to all the alleged fraudulent activity in her agreement.  
According to a federal indictment, Bishop was paid about $5.8 million from June 2008 through March 2009 by providing the false “proof of funds” documentation, facilitated through Apogee Financial Inc. in New York.
Bishop operated her business through several Odessa companies, which have been complained about publicly as far back as 2007 on websites such as RipoffReport.com and online forum topics.
“Bishop convinced clients to wire tens of thousands of dollars to her in exchange for a POF letter that showed they had tens of millions (sometimes hundreds of millions) of dollars in a bank account,” according to the indictment, for example being paid $164,000 to provide a fraudulent voucher for $100 million in a Wachovia account.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office recently filed a proposed jury instruction before the plea requesting that in the event of a trial the jury be instructed that Bishop may have used “deliberate ignorance” to blind herself from the criminal wrongdoings of her actions.
Bishop has also been named in a Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit for another reported multi-million dollar investment scheme.
According to that lawsuit, a Colorado man sought out Bishop and a Las Vegas, Nev., man to help him market a scheme that promised a $2 million return on a $44,000 investment in 10 to 12 banking days.
Several reports had been made to the Odessa Police Department about counterfeit checks and theft, according to front-page reports, but no arrests were made in the cases for various reasons, such as inability to prove she knew it was a counterfeit check, no actual victim and determined to be a civil case instead of criminal.
Several reports also were made about domestic disputes, resulting in assaults, between Bishop and a family member in 2010.

Former Trust nurse pleads guilty to fraud following internal probe 


Date published: 04 April 2012
		


 Print



A former nurse and employee of The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and NHS Manchester has pleaded guilty of fraud following an internal investigation. 

Ann-Marie McCoy, 34, from Norden, was charged with fraudulently acquiring payment of sick pay from both NHS Manchester (Primary Care Trust) between September and November 2010 and The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust between July and August 2011. 

Employed as a registered nurse, Ms McCoy was based at Charlestown Road Health Centre in Blackley, North Manchester, and had transferred employment as part of a service transfer from NHS Manchester to the Pennine Acute Trust in April 2011. 

An enquiry by Pennine Acute Trust’s counter fraud officer revealed that Ms McCoy had worked at a nursing agency during both periods of sick leave. She had been paid a total net amount of £5,698.44 in respect of sick pay by the NHS. 

On Thursday 22 March 2012 Ms McCoy pleaded guilty to both counts at Bury Magistrates Court. 

Sentencing included a Community Service Order for 12 months with 40 hours unpaid work, attendance at Probation Service course and £1,000 costs to be paid at £50 per month. She would also be reported to her professional body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) as a result of her actions. 

Ms McCoy no longer works for the Trust. Although Ms McCoy resigned from the Trust on 15 August 2011 prior to any disciplinary action, she had signed an agreement to repay the money paid to her in sick pay and continues with these payments. 

Sue Smith, counter fraud officer at The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 
“This Trust is absolutely committed to maintaining an honest, open and well intentioned atmosphere within the Trust. It is therefore also committed to the elimination of any fraud and to the rigorous investigation and punishment of any such cases. The vast majority of staff who work in the NHS are honest. But NHS staff who carry out fraud should be aware of the consequences of their actions. 

“If anyone suspects fraud within the NHS, they should ring the NHS Fraud and Corruption Reporting Line on 0800 028 40 60 where they can report suspicions in complete confidence.”

			Two San Francisco antique dealers accused of $1.5 million art loan fraud		

Share this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)By Bay City News Service | Mercury NewsJanuary 17, 2014 at 3:56 a.m.
Two antique dealers who ran a specialty financial service that supposedly used art as collateral have been charged in federal court in San Jose with carrying out a fraud in which they allegedly bilked investors out of $1.5 million. 
Anthony Barreiro, 64, and Ernest Ray Parker, also known as Ray Parker Gaylord, 50, operated a San Francisco company called ARTLoan Financial Inc. They were also partners in an antique business, Charles Gaylord & Co., that was founded by Parker’s father. 
Both men are residents of both San Francisco and Dallas, according to U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag. 
They were charged in an indictment issued under seal by a federal grand jury in September with 12 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud allegedly committed between 2008 and 2010. 


The indictment was unsealed on Jan. 10 after they made an initial appearance in federal court in Dallas. The defendants, both of whom are free on bond, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Paul Grewal in San Jose today and are due to return to the court of U.S. Magistrate Howard Lloyd on Feb. 11 for identification of their defense lawyers. 
The indictment alleges they told investors their funds were being used to lend money to collectors who wanted to buy valuable works of art and that ARTLoan Financial would hold the art as collateral. 
In fact, the indictment contends, the two men did not use investors’ money to fund any debt financing agreements, did not secure works of art as collateral and took some of the funds for themselves. 
The indictment alleges that Barreiro and Parker obtained $3.4 million in investments. They allegedly diverted $1.5 million for their personal use and, in a so-called Ponzi scheme, made $1.8 million in purported interest and principal payments to lull their current investors and induce others to invest. 
If convicted, the two men face sentences of up to 20 years in prison for each count. The not-yet-scheduled trial in the case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh of San Jose.

A crackdown on corruption was a central election campaign pledge of the country’s new president, Muhammadu Buhari. Photograph: AlamyGlobal development is supported byAbout this contentReutersTue 2 Jun 2015 12.24 BSTLast modified on Thu 15 Oct 2020 14.33 BSTNigeria’s anti-corruption body is set to charge senior officials from the central bank and some commercial lenders following their arrest in connection with an alleged 8bn naira ($40m) currency fraud scheme, it said on Monday.The Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) said six central bank officials and 16 commercial bank staff accused of currency theft and recirculating naira notes intended for destruction would appear in court on Tuesday. “Instead of carrying out the statutory instruction to destroy the currency, they substituted it with newspapers neatly cut to naira sizes and proceeded to recycle the defaced and mutilated currency,” the EFCC said in a statement.It was unclear from the statement which of Nigeria’s banks were involved.The announcement comes just days after President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in as leader of Africa’s biggest economy and top oil exporter. A crackdown on corruption was one of his central election campaign pledges.The Central Bank of Nigeria said the alleged fraud scheme was uncovered last September when a routine audit revealed irregularities in the south-western city of Ibadan. “The CBN has also conducted a nationwide audit of all 37 branches of the bank and found that this was an isolated scheme at Ibadan branch,” it said in a statement on Monday. “On further investigation ordered by the governor, it was discovered that a systematic scheme, which has been on for several years, was being run in which mutilated higher denomination notes originally meant for destruction were swapped with lower denomination currencies. This practice, known as interleafing, basically labels a box with a higher value than its true content.” The central bank regularly withdraws old or torn notes from circulation to replace them with new ones. The naira has lost 8.5% of its value since the start of the year after sharp falls in the price of oil, Nigeria’s main export, forced the central bank into a de facto devaluation in February in order to save its dwindling foreign reserves.Nigeria is also $63bn in debt and is borrowing to pay government workers. During the last week of May, it endured fuel shortages that crippled banks and businesses and grounded flights.TopicsGovernanceNigeriaAfricanewsReuse this contentcomments (0)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion.comments (0)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion.WorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Fyre Festival founder Billy McFarland pleads guilty to fraud
He faces up to 40 years in prison
By Tom Connick
6th March 2018 








Fyre Festival owner Billy McFarland has pleaded guilty to fraud, and now faces up to 40 years in prison.
The failed festival hit headlines last year, after the first edition of the ‘luxury’ event soon turned into a dystopian nightmare in May.
Despite promising punters luxury accommodation and a line-up that included the likes of Major Lazer, the event quickly descended into chaos when it took place. The company behind it was later forced into bankruptcy, though McFarland originally pleaded not guilty back in October.
Advertisement Now, though, appearing in court today (March 6), he has admitted to two counts of wire fraud. As TMZ report, each count faces up to 20 years in jail – sentencing is set for June of this year.
New documents also show that promoter Billy McFarlane’s budgeting was a mess – despite failing to factor in costs for toilets, the organiser spent $160,000 on a yacht for headliners Blink-182, who pulled out ahead of the festival regardless.
Other expenses included $18,208 on towels, and $260,000 on carpet for ‘tent city’, which costed around $470,000. Despite these costs, the festival was left without running water when punters arrived on-site.

Ja Rule, who is a business partner of McFarland’s, has not been charged with any offences, but has been named as a defendant in many of the civil lawsuits that have been brought against McFarland, Fyre Festival and Fyre Media since the ill-fated event.

He had a girlfriend who doted on him, loaned him money when he needed it, and was totally oblivious to the fact that he was dating someone else.Follow the latest on Election 2020chevron-rightNot just someone else. Sixteen someones else.For months, Yuan (whose first name has not been identified in the Chinese news media) somehow managed to juggle relationships with 17 different women. It seems to have worked fine until he got into a car accident in March. When the hospital reached out to his relatives, they and, somehow, all 17 women came running — resulting in an awkward waiting room meeting.“I was really worried when I heard that he was in hospital,” one of the girlfriends, Xiao Li, told the South China Morning Post in April. “But when I started seeing more and more beautiful girls show up, I couldn’t cry any more.”ADADAnother, who had a son with Yuan, worried about how she should respond.“What can I do now? I don’t love him any more, but I do love my son,” she said.In answer to her question, Xiao set up an online chat group for the 17 duped girlfriends ominously named the “revenge alliance,” according to the Morning Post. There they exchanged stories, commiserated and learned that Yuan had asked them all for money on a regular basis — one woman had been providing him with financial support for nine years.Now Yuan has been arrested for fraud in connection with his exploits, the Morning Post reported Tuesday. It appears to be enough of a revenge for his 17 former lovers — they’ve changed their group’s name to “angels.”Today’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyComments are not available on this story.Share your feedback by emailing the author.

A Baton Rouge man was arrested Tuesday after police say he assessed a home for flood repairs, took more than $70,000 in payments to do the job, but never completed any of the work, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department. Wilson Reado Jr., 68, is accused of entering into a written agreement on Oct. 8 to repair the home, receiving two installments of payment then refusing to do work for the client, his arrest report says. The woman sent Reado, of Landmark Building Consultants LLC, a $30,000 check and then later a $40,281.79 check, the report says. She and her son got into an argument with Reado over the phone because he had received her money but had not done any work, the report says. Reado said he no longer wanted to do the work because of the argument, the report says. The woman mailed a certified letter to Reado telling him to complete the work or return the money. Reado never replied to the letter or made an attempt to contact the client, the report says. Reado, 9401 Shady Bluff Drive, was booked Tuesday into Parish Prison on a count of home improvement fraud, contractor's misappropriation of payments, and theft of over $25,000.

                    Steve Mayes | The Oregonian/OregonLive
                   A former Bank of Oswego executive fired for financial misconduct was arraigned in federal court Tuesday on charges that he subsequently defrauded an investor out of $200,000.Geoffrey S. Walsh is charged with five counts of wire fraud, two counts of engaging in monetary transactions with criminally derived property and one count of making a false statement on a loan application.According to theindictment, Walsh borrowed $500,000 from an unidentified Beaverton businessman on May 3, 2012, the day after the bank fired him. The loan was to be secured by two Southern California condos owned by a company Walsh controlled. Walsh repaid $300,000 in June after learning the investor had contacted the authorities.Walsh misrepresented his financial condition, sold one of the condos a week later without telling the investor and did not disclose that he would use the loan for his personal expenses, rather than for business purposes, according to the indictment.Walsh pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released while he awaits trial on Oct. 1.It is unclear whether Walsh, 43, will face additional charges.The FBI began investigating Walsh last year, shortly after he was fired as Bank of Oswego's vice president for lending and business development. The bank said his ""unacceptable banking practices"" led to his termination.Federal prosecutor Claire Fay urged U.S. District Magistrate Paul Papak to impose tight restrictions on Walsh that would limit his ability to broker loans or spend his own money. Fay said that Walsh engaged in a ""pattern of soliciting and obtaining loans and using them for the benefit for himself and others"" and characterized some of his activities as ""high-risk Ponzi.""But Fay offered nothing to support her claims.Papak said he would not impose limits on Walsh's ability to send money or engage in legitimate business activity without a compelling reason. Fay will make her case at a hearing Wednesday.The Bank of Oswego sued Walsh in Clackamas County Circuit Court last summer seeking $600,000 in damages. The bank alleges that Walsh misappropriated trade secrets and breached his duty as a bank official. The bank also is foreclosing on a Gearhart Beach house and Lake Oswego home owned by Walsh's wife.The lawsuit centers on a $1.7 million line of credit extended to Lake Oswego businessman Martin ""Marty"" Kehoe. Walsh told the bank's loan committee the credit line would be used for business investment and operating expenses for two of Kehoe's companies, Onboard Capital Co. and MSF Auto Leasing LLC, according to the lawsuit.The bank claims Kehoe used the money to make auto loans and ""hard-money"" loans -- short-term high-interest real estate loans that typically don't conform to bank lending standards -- to Bank of Oswego customers.Even more troubling to the bank: Walsh was one of Kehoe's borrowers. He received a $132,000 loan from Onboard Capital Co. and a $250,000 loan from MSF Auto Leasing LLC, according to the lawsuit. Kehoe denies lending Walsh any money.The bank, unaware Walsh and six of its customers were now deeper in debt, faced increased risk.The lawsuit cites a panicky email Kehoe sent to Walsh on April 5, 2012, where Kehoe complained that his borrowers stopped making payments to Onboard Capital. ""This has reached an emergency point for me,"" Kehoe wrote. ""Get these guys some financing or squeeze them to pay me off.""""Everything I've been working towards is slowly going down the (expletive omitted) because of these loans. They have to go away and they have to go now,"" Kehoe said in the email.He offered Walsh some suggestions. Among them: ""Get these guys some financing or squeeze them to pay me off.""Walsh responded by email: ""I will have u done quicker than u know. I am very close. I promise you, I understand your plight.""Walsh persuaded the bank to extend Kehoe's repayment deadline. The credit line was paid off but it is unclear whether Walsh paid off his loans.Walsh also ran afoul of bank rules by using customers' financial and personal information as well as information he apparently obtained from his former employers.The bank discovered a trove of documents and electronic records after Walsh was fired, according to the lawsuit.The bank alleged that after Walsh was fired he conspired with a Bank of Oswego official who resigned in March 2012 to share confidential customer information with a private lender.Last year, Bank of Oswego President Dan Heine told FBI agents that Walsh worked all kinds of ""weird"" hours and routinely transferred crates of bank files to and from his car, according to a federal search warrant affidavit.As the civil case moves forward, the bank expects to find additional misconduct, Bank of Oswego attorney Casey Nokes told a Clackamas County judge at a hearing Monday. ""To think we're not going to discover more bad acts by Mr. Walsh, I think, is naive,"" Nokes said.-- Steve MayesNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our   User Agreement,  Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,  and Your California Privacy Rights  (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.

		Man Charged in $7.5 Million Miami Heat Fraud to Plead Guilty	



Published October 2, 2014 •
Updated on October 2, 2014 at 6:28 am 



















A man charged with a multimillion-dollar investment scam involving three former Miami Heat players and the team itself wants to take responsibility for his actions and move on, his attorney said ahead of an expected plea deal.
 
The government alleges that Haider Zafar defrauded players Mike Miller, James Jones and Rashard Lewis in 2013 by promising to invest $7.5 million in various business opportunities. Instead, prosecutors say, Zafar kept the money and used some of it to buy a $1 million, three-season Heat ticket package.
 
Zafar faces five wire fraud charges that each carry maximum 20-year prison sentences.
 
That case is being consolidated with another against Zafar in Columbus, where a federal judge set a plea hearing for the Miami Heat case for Thursday.
 
Zafar, currently in Franklin County Jail, is pleading guilty to the Miami Heat allegations to accept responsibility and become a productive citizen again, his attorney, Sam Shamanksy, said Wednesday.
 
""He's not interested in litigation in Miami, he's interested in making all the parties whole and accepting whatever punishment is appropriate,"" Shamansky said.
 
In Miami, Zafar portrayed himself as a member of a wealthy and influential Pakistani family that operated several hotels, textile plants and oil businesses, according to an indictment in Florida earlier this year. He claimed he lived in a penthouse in The Essex house in New York, but also had residences at upscale addresses in Miami, the indictment said. 
 
In a separate case in Ohio, a 135-count indictment filed last year described a scheme under which Zafar allegedly swindled a Washington, D.C., businessman out of $10 million between 2008 and 2010.
 
Zafar was accused of claiming that his uncle headed the defense department in Pakistan and thus had inside information about land sales to the government, an IRS agent testified in court.
 
Zafar persuaded his fraud victim to provide $10 million to buy parcels of land which he said could be resold to the government at an inflated price, according to the agent's testimony at a February hearing where Zafar pleaded guilty to wire fraud, money laundering and tax evasion charges.

Officer Yaniris Deleon was taken into custody while on duty in Manhattan Wednesday by federal agents. (Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News)             A hardened fraudster ran a massive $18 million insurance fraud scam that involved an NYPD cop and five crooked 911 operators, prosecutors charged Thursday.     Ringleader Anthony Rose, 51, ran the elaborate no-fault insurance scheme that involved bribes to NYPD employees and hospital staff who handed over the confidential information of people involved in car crashes. All told, 27 people were charged in the scheme, including Rose’s wife and son.     Advertisement         The lone cop, Officer Yaniris Deleon, was taken into custody while on duty in Long Island City at 5:15 a.m. by federal agents with assault weapons drawn, sources said. Deleon, 29, and the 911 operators received monthly bribes from Rose of as much as $4,000 to keep the confidential info flowing.     “There is no place for corruption within the NYPD,” Police Commissioner James O’Neill said in a statement. “By tarnishing the shield, as well as their sacred oaths, these employees will be held the highest account the law provides.”                Advertisement         The names, addresses and contact numbers for about 60,000 crash victims were disclosed to the scam artists over the last five years, officials said.     [More New York] Bronx man on moped struck and killed by drunk driver a block away from home »     Once Rose and his fellow fraudsters had the info, 10 to 15 hustlers working at a phony “call center” called up crash victims and steered them to handpicked lawyers and medical clinics, prosecutors said. Those lawyers and clinics then gave Rose kickbacks, which he used as payments and bribes, authorities charged.               About 6,000 crash victims actually visited clinics and lawyers in on the scheme. Each referral earned Rose and his cronies $3,000 on average, prosecutors said. The scam running since 2014 involved burner phones, code names and spreadsheets tracking bribe payments, according to an indictment.     “Anthony Rose and his associates masterminded a brazen scheme that involved bribing 911 operators, medical personnel, and police officers for the confidential information of tens of thousands of motor vehicle accident victims. These actions have undermined the integrity of our emergency and medical first responders,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said.     [More New York] Man shot to death inside Brooklyn lounge »          The ringleader of the operation was a hardcore conman who had used 13 pseudonyms, different social security numbers and dates of birth, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mathew Andrews said. Rose controlled bank accounts that at times allegedly held hundreds of thousands of dollars. He’d traveled extensively to the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, Bermuda, Jamiaca and Cuba.     “Rose commented to his co-conspirators he was considering moving his entire operation to Costa Rica because it was cheaper and he has contacts there,” Matthews said in Manhattan Federal Court.     The government claims to have 10 months of wiretapped conversations in which Rose details exactly how the scheme worked.     [More New York] NYPD officer accused in 2019 of fondling himself in front of girl hit with charges for two more incidents with other children »     Rose told the callers to target victims in minority communities because he believed they would be easy marks, according to the feds.          “The hood is number one,” Rose allegedly told co-conspirators. “All that Manhattan s--t, those people got attorneys. We need all the hood cases.”     The “call center” scammers followed a script in which they claimed there were from a group affiliated with the city Department of Transportation, the indictment charged. They claimed they obtained crash victims’s names and numbers through a “personal injury hotline.”     [More New York] MS-13 member who participated in 2016 murder of teen on Long Island extradited from El Salvador: feds »     The callers even brazenly lied to the accident victims, claiming they were trying to protect them from scammers who obtain private information illegally and mislead victims, federal officials said.

She pleaded not guilty.     “She’s a hardworking law enforcement officer for a number of years,” Deleon’s attorney Guy Oksenhendler stated.     “Most of the charges in the indictment have nothing to do with her.”     She and the other NYPD employees were told they could make anywhere between $24,000 and $30,000 ""off the books” if they kept the fraudsters flush with names, prosecutors said.

		Accused man found guilty of 32 counts of wire and mail fraud	

Local News


		
					Posted: Mar 4, 2020 / 06:28 PM HST

HONOLULU (KHON2) — A man has been found guilty of 32 counts of wire and mail fraud. 
Forty-eight-year-old Anthony Williams of Nashville, Tennesse is scheduled for sentencing on June 24, 2020. 
According to the evidence presented at trial, Williams marketed a fraudulent mortgage debt reduction scheme to distressed homeowners, who were mostly non-native English speakers in the Filipino immigrant community in Hawaii. Williams created two companies, Mortgage Enterprise Investments (MEI) and Common Law Office of America (CLOA), neither of which was licensed to service or modify mortgages. 
Through MEI, Williams made conflicting promises to clients that he could eliminate their existing mortgage obligations to their lenders, or reduce their mortgage obligations by half. Through CLOA, Williams promised legal representation in mortgage-related litigation and foreclosure proceedings. 
To give himself the appearance of credibility, Williams told prospective clients he was a “private attorney general” and brandished an official-looking law enforcement badge and credentials, despite not having a law license or any affiliation with law enforcement. 
The evidence at trial demonstrated that Williams falsely promised victims that he could eliminate their existing home mortgage obligations by filing bogus documents with the Hawaii Bureau of Conveyances. 
These documents included new MEI mortgages and notes obligating homeowners to make monthly payments to MEI. Williams then advised homeowners to stop making their mortgage payments to their lenders and to pay him instead. 
The government presented evidence that between 2012 and 2015, Williams enlisted 112 victims in Hawaii into his MEI program and fraudulently obtained over $218,000. Furthermore, several victims testified at trial that they relied upon Williams’s representations and went into foreclosure as a result of the MEI program and lost their homes. 
The investigation was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

				For Ron Lee, history repeats itself two decades later as Tagovailoa, de Laura and Cordeiro get starting nods
					

				by Christian Shimabuku / Nov 7, 2020 

When Cal and Ron Lee returned to coach the Saint Louis football program in 2014, a dynasty was eventually restored.
The brothers guided ‘The Brotherhood’ to 14 consecutive Hawaii state titles from 1986 to 1999 before Cal Lee resigned as the head coach following the 2001 season. Ever since the HHSAA introduced the Open Division as its highest tier of competition in 2016, no team other than the Crusaders have staked their claim as the best in the state.

				by Max Rodriguez / Nov 6, 2020 

HONOLULU (KHON2) -- The United States did not have an official president-elect as of Nov. 6, although the chairs for the Republican and Democratic state parties believe both have seen gains in Hawaii this election.
Joe Biden's lead in four key states was too close to call by the end of the workweek. The Democratic Party of Hawaii Chair Tyler Dos Santos-Tam said the party remains hopeful, even if Georgia -- which turned blue by a slim margin -- does a ballot recount.

				Trade winds and sunshine return to the islands this weekend
					

				by Justin Cruz / Nov 6, 2020 

HONOLULU (KHON2) -- Breezy trades will slowly return across the state through Saturday and is expected to pick up a notch on Sunday. Clouds and passing showers will favor windward and mountain areas of each island with higher coverage in the overnight to early morning hours. Moisture associated with the remnants of an old cold front should move into the islands, producing a brief period of enhanced showers across the state around Monday. Otherwise expect more blustery trade wind weather to last through the first half of next week. Another upper level disturbance is expected towards the end of the week and will likely bring some unsettled weather.

An officer of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been arrested from Central Delhi’s Daryaganj area for allegedly duping three persons of nearly Rs 65 lakh, by “selling” the same property to all of them. Two more accused, who helped the officer carry out the fraud with the help of forged documents, are absconding, said the police.
The arrest of Harjeet Kumar, the RBI’s 57-year-old assistant manager, was confirmed by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Parmaditya.
Kumar was arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by Satpal Saini, a resident of Sonepat. “In his complaint, Saini claimed that Kumar had misused his post and duped him with the help of two of his associates. In 2012, the trio claimed to be the owners of a 2,000-square yard property at Daryaganj and offered to sell it to him,” said a police officer.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The complainant claimed that after checking the property, he agreed to buy it for Rs 3 crore, and gave Rs 10 lakh to the trio as the token amount. Saini told the police that he handed over Rs 31 lakh to the three accused later and requested them to complete the paperwork related to the transaction.
In his police complaint, Saini said that after receiving the money, the accused started avoiding him. “After Saini made some inquiries, he realised that the property did not belong to them. He also realised that they had cheated two more persons by selling the same property to them,” the officer added.
The accused then allegedly threatened Saini, warning him of dire consequences if he informed anyone about the matter. “During the investigation, police came to know that the property belongs to another person. After going through the property documents, they informed the RBI about the FIR against their officer. They later arrested the accused from his residence but his two associates managed to escape,” said the police officer.

Langley pair arrested for massive fraud operationLANGLEY ADVANCE 
									09.11.2014Two men from Langley have been arrested and thousands of dollars of items seized after several police agencies teamed up.North Shore News
								/ ...ShareAdjustCommentPrintTwo men from Langley have been arrested and thousands of dollars of items seized after several police agencies teamed up.The charges will even include a data breach of PharmaNet.On July 17, the RCMP ""E"" Division Federal Serious and Organized Crime Section (FSOC), with the assistance of Langley RCMP, the Lower Mainland Emergency Response Team and the Integrated Forensic Identification Section, executed a search warrant at a north Langley residence during an investigation of several large fraudulent transactions.The FSOC investigation was initiated in June 2014 after a common suspect was identified through Abbotsford Police, Victoria Police and Burnaby RCMP investigations.As a result of the search warrant, police seized:- in excess of $100,000 worth of construction, excavation and lawn equipment- over 13,000 credit card numbers- personal identity information for many individuals who had no association to the residence- counterfeit government identity documents in various stages of manufacture- equipment required to manufacture counterfeit documents- a Canada Post uniform""These items are believed to have been acquired through fraud and many of the individuals identified and contacted during this investigation process were previously unaware that they had been victimized,"" said S/Sgt. John Taylor of FSOC.One man was arrested on outstanding fraud charges and is being held in custody.Giovanni Michael Aiello, 32, and Nichole Maria McGregor, 36, both of Langley, are each facing several charges including fraud, identity theft, possession of property obtained by crime and possession of instruments for forging credit cards.One of their charges is in relation to the recent PharmaNet data breach.""Economic integrity is an RCMP priority and as a result the RCMP investigates and disrupts a variety of offences associated to financial crime,"" said Taylor. ""Individuals involved in criminal behaviour are often active in many areas of illegal activity.""Public awareness is an important tool in preventing the victimization of Canadians.The RCMP offers some tips for helping protect personal information and preventing fraud and identity theft:- Identity theft can occur over the Internet or telephone, or via fax or regular mail. Be wary of unsolicited e-mails, telephone calls or mail attempting to extract personal or financial information from you.- Periodically check your credit reports, bank and credit card statements. Report any irregularities to your financial institution or to one of the following credit reporting agencies: Equifax Canada - 1 800 465 7166 or Transunion - 1 877 525 3823- Shield your personal identification number when using an ATM or PIN pad.- Shred personal and financial documents prior to disposing of them.If you feel you may be a victim of fraud:- Contact your bank or credit card issuer immediately. They may block your card to prevent losses, ask you to change your PIN or cancel your card and issue you a new one. The bank may ask you to sign an affidavit if there are fraudulent transactions in your account. If there is money missing from your account, they will work to get it back as quickly as possible.- Contact your credit bureau and have fraud alerts placed on your credit reports.- Contact your local police.Click here to read more stories from The Langley Advance.

GEICO accused of systematic fraud in lawsuit

GEICO accused of systematic fraud in lawsuit | Insurance Business




GEICO General Insurance Company, the second largest auto insurer in the United States, has been accused in a major lawsuit of systematic fraud due to its alleged denial of legitimate personal injury protection (PIP) claims.
The formal complaint and demand for jury trial was filed by the Florida Spine and Joint Institute (FSJI) with the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court of Florida on Tuesday, April 07. The plaintiff is seeking damages in excess of $750,000 (exclusive of attorneys’ fees, interest, and costs) and for declaratory relief regarding “tortious interference with a contractual or business relationship, and defamation arising out of GEICO’s refusal to reimburse FSJI for PIP benefits coverage and dissemination of false statements concerning FSJI’s business practices.” 




Under Florida’s Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law, all drivers are required to carry PIP insurance coverage, and all insurers are required to provide PIP coverage for injury, sickness, disease, or death arising out of the ownership or maintenance of a motor vehicle. FSJI is a licensed healthcare provider that offers medical services to patients who have suffered personal injuries in motor vehicle accidents, and then, by law, the organization “submits claims for reimbursement to its patients’ insurers for PIP benefits pursuant to Florida’s PIP Statute”.
However, according to the complaint filed by the FSJI, the Berkshire Hathaway-owned firm is allegedly “engaging in systematic fraud by denying coverage to their customers by refusing to pay for legitimate medical services [rendered by the FSJI] covered under the applicable policies and governed by Florida’s PIP Statute.”

In the court documents, the auto insurer said it is not required to pay the denied claims, for reasons that differ on a case-by-case basis. The reasons include: “(1) FSJI’s medical directors are not fulfilling their duties as set forth in Section 400.9935, Florida Statutes; (2) FSJI is inappropriately billing GEICO under Florida’s PIP statute for services rendered through the participation of FSJI’s licensed massage therapists (“LMTs”);  (3) FSJI is engaging in ‘upcoding’, or charging its patients for higher level medical services in lieu of more inexpensive, conservative treatment; and (4)  FSJI’s billing for timed codes is not matching its hours of operation.”
In addition, GEICO has reportedly sent letters to FSJI’s patients (an exemplar of which was included in FSJI’s complaint) claiming the organization “is engaging in fraudulent billing” and that “GEICO has a reasonable belief that a fraudulent insurance act under Section 626.989 or 817.234, Fla. Stat., has been committed with respect to [your] claim.”
FSJI argues these letters are disseminating false information and are defamatory in nature. The organization quotes one of the letters in the complaint: “GEICO, having knowledge of FSJI’s existing contractual and business relationships with its patients, intentionally and unjustifiably interfered with those contracts and relationships by sending the Defamatory Letters to FSJI’s GEICO Patients, which contained false allegations of fraud against FSJI. As a direct and proximate result of GEICO’s actions, FSJI has suffered and will continue to suffer significant damages including, without limitation, loss in good will, damages to its reputation, and damages in amount to be proven at trial.”
FSJI seeks trial by jury on all counts so triable. Ryan Fulcher, CEO of FSJI told Insurance Business: “We will not allow GEICO to interfere with important and necessary medical care for its customers who are our patients, and so we hope this lawsuit will quickly result in GEICO finally providing its policyholders with the insurance benefits they were promised.”
A spokesperson for GEICO said the firm will not comment on pending litigation.

                    Brent Hunsberger | For The Oregonian/OregonLive
                   He told investors they'd get their money back. Investors were also promised again and again that their payoff was imminent. ""Investors have done really well with us,"" Yusaf Jawed said in a 2010 interview with The Oregonian.But next week, federal authorities say, the Portland-area hedge-fund manager will admit in federal court that none of it was true.U.S. prosecutors in Portland say they expect Jawed on Tuesday to plead guilty to 17 counts of mail and wire fraud related to what they say is a long-running Ponzi scheme he orchestrated through his firm, Grifphon Asset Management. MoreContinuing coverage of Yusaf Jawed and what U.S. prosecutors say is a long-running Ponzi scheme he orchestrated through Grifphon Asset Management.Under a plea agreement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Allan Garten said he will ask U.S. District Judge Ancer Haggerty to sentence Jawed to 6-and-a-half years in prison and order him to repay $6.4 million taken from more than 10 investors between February 2008 and September 2009.The deal, pending judicial approval, would resolve a criminal investigation into an elaborate scheme that ran more than a decade and entailed much larger sums. Jawed claimed in the 2010 interview that he managed $63 million for 150 investors through Lake Oswego-based Grifphon and related entities.""The guilty plea is good because at least the taxpayers and the victims of his crime aren't going to have to pay for his criminal trial,"" said Michael Esler, a Portland attorney representing dozens of Grifphon investors.Under the plea deal, Esler and Garten said, Jawed will pledge to cooperate withthe investors' lawsuitagainst Grifphon's accounting and law firms. That lawsuit could be the only hope of investors recovering any of their money, Esler said. A federal court last year found Jawed had no money and appointed a court-paid attorney to represent him.""No one expects the $6.4 million will ever be paid by him,"" Esler said.Jawed also will pledge to cooperate with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission'songoing civil investigationinto the scheme, Garten said.Jawed's current attorney, Ron Hoevet, declined to comment.Jawed started forming loosely regulated hedge funds in 2000 after getting fired from a securities firm in Portland.A New York Stock Exchange investigationeventually found Jawed traded without permission in a customer's account and tried to cover it up.He used his ties -- asan alum of Reed Collegeand a network of brokers and other associates -- to lure large and small investors to give him money.Jawed promised to invest in publicly traded stocks, bragged of double- and triple-digit returns and offered up audited financial statements, according to information filed in U.S. District Court last month and provided to The Oregonian on Thursday by Garten.At one point, he told investors he had lined up an overseas buyer for the fund ahead of their investments, according to the information.In reality, very little money was ever invested, the information said. From 2008 to 2009, most of the $6.4 million he raised was used to pay for finders' fees, commissions, loans and expenses, and to pay prior investors.Jawed never secured a buyer for any of his funds, according to the information. He tried to cover up his diversions, including by falsely listing bonds on the books of his hedge funds, the information said.He also sent out account and tax statements to investors that falsely depicted big returns. Investors actually paid taxes on the false gains that Jawed listed on the K-1 partnership tax statements, Garten said.Yet privately, ""Jawed was sending out internal emails stating that the Grifphon enterprise was in dire financial straits and needed fresh infusions of investor funds to survive,"" the federal information said.Jawed hired attorneys to lend an air of legitimacy to his claims, and some of those ""lawyers were in fact instrumental in Jawed's scheme to deceive investors,"" the information said.Jawed also advertised that accountants had reviewed the accuracy of his books. But according to the federal information, accountants couldn't verify the books and records because Jawed and associates failed to respond to repeated requests for information.SEC attorneys say they continue to press their civil fraud case, filed in U.S. District Court last year, against Jawed and one of his attorneys, Robert Custis. The suit alleges Jawed used investor money to pay for a lavish lifestyle and to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit.Custis has denied the allegations. The SEC said that during its investigation, Custis invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.-- Brent HunsbergerNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our   User Agreement,  Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,  and Your California Privacy Rights  (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.

SAN MARTIN — A pair of San Martin brothers spearheaded a scheme where nearly two-dozen people staged car crashes to cash in on more than $200,000 in phony insurance claims, authorities said.

The brothers, 36-year-old Angel Topete and 34-year-old Joshua Topete, were among 18 people — mostly Santa Clara County residents — arrested over the past month in connection with 18 “staged collisions” reported over a three-year stretch, according to the state Department of Insurance and Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office.
Four suspects are still being sought. One of the defendants charged in the case, Gerardo Ivan Espinosa Martinez, 31, was already being prosecuted in a separate insurance fraud case involving 15 other allegedly staged collisions.


“This large ring of family and friends allegedly conspired to defraud insurers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a statement. “The cost of insurance fraud is shouldered by consumers who pay higher premiums when insurers pass along their losses. Working with our task force partners is critical in combating the multi-billion dollar problem of insurance fraud.”
Investigators with the Silicon Valley Automobile Insurance Fraud Task Force opened a case in 2015 and eventually determined that the Topete brothers masterminded a scheme where their family, friends and other associates filed fraudulent claims with six different insurers “for collisions that were either staged or never occurred at all,” authorities said.

The task force, made up of personnel from the Department of Insurance, the District Attorney’s Office and California Highway Patrol, contends that the defendants took up new policies under multiple names and then intentionally crashed their cars into each other. Some of the cars involved were salvaged vehicles.
The subsequent fraudulent claims they filed, declaring the total loss of a vehicle, netted a total of $210,000, authorities said.
The District Attorney’s Office said in a news release that the collisions were “often reported as caused by a distracted river striking parked vehicles,” and were reported between 2012 and 2015.


The highest single claim was for $37,723, prosecutors said. Two San Jose auto-body shops, Espinosa Body Shop and Auto Parts USA, were implicated.
It was the involvement of the Espinosa Body Shop that appears to have broken open the most recent fraud case: A Farmers Insurance investigators noticed that damage on one of the cars did not match a corresponding claim, and remembered that the shop was already accused of fraud.

Newton Jackson, retired judge of Wicomico County sitting in the Worcester County Circuit Court. The charges stemmed from several similar complaints received by the Ocean Pines Police Department from Ocean Pines’ residents from October 2017 through June 2018, the Worcester County State’s Attorney’s office said in a news release. Each complainant had hired Allen to do various types of landscaping and home improvement work. Allen accepted payments from the victims, several of whom were over the age of 68, making them vulnerable adults, but failed to complete the agreed-upon work despite repeated demands by his victims, it said. Allen is not licensed through the Maryland Home Improvement Commission to perform home improvement work as required by law, the release said. The court deferred sentencing for Allen to pay restitution to the victims. He faces a total of two years and six months in prison.Worcester County State’s Attorney Kris Heiser urged county residents to use free online resources to conduct checks on any individuals they plan to hire for home improvement work. Residents can use Maryland Judiciary Case Search (www.mdcourts.gov) to search for criminal records, and can the Maryland Home Improvement Commission website (www.dllr.state.md.us/license/mhic) to determine if an individual possesses the requisite license to perform home improvement work, the release said.More: Maryland gun laws: 3 Lower Shore sheriffs join ranks against restrictive gun billsMore: Burn pit fire that got out of hand leaves one dead: Officials About Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.delmarvanow.com.

OGDEN — A former employee of a northern Utah credit union has been arrested and accused of stealing personal account information of customers and giving it to others who fraudulently spent money from those accounts, according to police.
Perla Esmeralda Ramirez-Coronado, 22, was charged Wednesday in 2nd District Court with engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity, a second-degree felony, and 18 counts of identity fraud, a third-degree felony.
The investigation began in January when North Ogden police responded to a residence on a report that a ledger belonging to Ramirez-Coronado was found in the home, according to a police affidavit. It does not say how police believe the ledger ended up in the residence.
“The complainant reported Perla worked for a credit union, and the information in the ledger appeared to be bank and personal identifier type information of members,” according to charging documents. 
Detectives determined Ramirez-Coronado had worked for a credit union in Ogden and the case was turned over to Ogden police. A detective reviewed the ledger and confirmed it contained the account numbers of 16 credit union members, the affidavit states. It does not say what credit union she worked for.
“The personal information included a detailed profile on each member to include: full name, date of birth, last four digits of their Social security number, and home address,” the charges state.
Police learned that Ramirez-Coronado had “abruptly quit” her job. Detectives then discovered that “a total of five fraudulent transactions have occurred on the accounts in the ledger for a total loss of $13,010. The fraud occurred in multiple cities in Minnesota. There are an additional two victims who had their personal identifiers, and bank account numbers stolen who were not in the ledger. The credit union sustained an additional $5,946 loss on those two accounts,” the charges state.
“In addition to the fraud on the account, several of the victims have had their identity and credit used to fraudulently purchase vehicles in Arizona and Minnesota,” the charges say.
Detectives learned that the victims listed on the ledger and the two who are not all “had made contact with the call center while Perla would have been working. The fraud on the victims’ accounts who were not in the ledger occurred in the same area of Minnesota, by the same group of co-conspirators identified in this scheme,” according to the charges.
“It appears Perla obtained the identity and bank account information of the members with the intent to distribute the information to co-conspirators with the intent to commit fraud,” police wrote in the report.
One of those individuals was identified as a man who previously served federal prison time for fraud, according to charging documents.
“He was on supervised release and traveled to Utah to be with Perla. (They) were observed in Salt Lake in a vehicle that was fraudulently purchased in Arizona with the identity of one of the victims,” the charges state.
The couple then went to Minnesota where they were stopped by police on Feb. 8 “in another vehicle that had been fraudulently purchased with information from one of the credit union victims. The male who was driving the vehicle had a fraudulent New York driver’s license. He ran from the scene and was not apprehended at that time,” according to the court documents.
Inside the car Ramirez-Coronado was pulled over in, police found keys to another vehicle that was also “fraudulently purchased with the use of one of the Utah credit union victims,” according to the charges.
As of Wednesday afternoon, no charges had been filed in Utah against the man whom  Ramirez-Coronado was allegedly with.

Texas Man James Pierce Pleads Guilty to Fraud Scheme Involving Fake Letters of Credit and Bank Documents

10/30/2019  STL.News Editor 1  


(STL.News) – A Texas man pleaded guilty today to defrauding victims around the United States by selling them fake “standby letters of credit” and other forged and fraudulent bank documents.
Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Assistant Director in Charge Timothy R. Slater of the FBI’s Washington Field Office made the announcement.
James Pierce, 43, of Spring, Texas, pleaded guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud before Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia.  Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 10, 2020, before Judge Howell.
As part of his guilty plea, Pierce admitted that he and his co-conspirators falsely represented to their victims that they had a relationship with a bank located in the Dominican Republic (“Bank 1”), that they could use to secure financing for the victims’ large commercial transactions.  In exchange for six-figure fees paid by the victims, the defendant and his co-conspirators falsely promised that the victims could gain access to credit at Bank 1.  They further represented that Bank 1 would issue Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) inter-bank messages to banks designated by the victims, showing that the victims had access to such credit.  In reality, the defendant and his co-conspirators had no such relationship with Bank 1, and provided the victims with fake Bank 1 documentation falsely showing that it had transmitted the promised bank instruments.  When the victims did not receive their SWIFT messages, the defendant and his co-conspirators gave the victims excuses and false statements, and in several instances, fraudulently induced the victims to pay additional money to have their bank documentation “re-issued” – which also never happened.  Pierce also used a website and email address at jpierceinvestments.com to carry out the fraud.
The FBI investigated the case.  Trial Attorney Blake Goebel and Assistant Chief Justin Weitz of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.

Harris continued working in health care, special agent Michael McCaslin testified Friday.Bradley and Amy Harris, shown in this undated photo from Facebook, were among 16 people indicted and accused in a $60 million Medicare fraud scheme. By Valerie Wigglesworth3:54 PM on Mar 3, 2017 CSTEmail IconNovus Health Services wasn't the only company at which federal regulators found ties to a man they have accused of defrauding Medicare and ordering overdoses for patients.A hearing in federal court in Dallas on Friday included testimony that Novus owner and CEO Bradley J. Harris continued working at hospice and home health care companies after regulators stopped Novus  from receiving Medicare payments because he was suspected of organizing a $60 million fraud.Harris, 35, of Frisco, had been in federal custody since his arrest Tuesday. He was indicted on 11 counts of health care fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and three counts of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance related to prescriptions such as morphine.Bradley and Amy Harris, shown in this undated photo from Facebook, were among 16 people indicted and accused in a $60 million Medicare fraud scheme. Harris' wife, Amy, and 14 other people associated with Novus and a related company, Optim Health Services, face similar charges in the indictment unsealed this week.  Novus was one of the largest hospice providers in North Texas.Harris and the others have pleaded not guilty.Even after the FBI raided Novus in 2015, Harris continued working in health care, special agent Michael McCaslin testified in court Friday.  Harris worked first with Dependable Hospice Care, then Choice Plus Home Health, which was the new name for Harris' Novus Home Health company, the agent said. Harris also had ties to Omnicare and Reliant health care companies, testimony showed.Harris didn't own Dependable Hospice Care in Dallas, but he made all the decisions, McCaslin testified. The agent referred to Dependable as Novus 2.0 with most of Novus' employees, some of its patients and even Novus' letterhead on some documents.Medicare payments were suspended for Dependable in May 2016 and for Choice Plus four months later because of suspicious activity, McCaslin testified.Harris' lawyer said that nothing in the law prevented Harris from working for another health business while the investigation was underway.Federal prosecutor Russell Fusco argued Friday that Harris should remain in custody until trial, citing him as a possible flight risk as well as a potential danger to the community. Harris faces up to life in prison if convicted, Fusco said.""When he's not being watched, he's breaking the law,"" Fusco told the court.But defense attorney Keith Rosen said that Harris has lots of strong ties to the community, has no criminal record and has remained in Frisco since learning about the investigation in 2015.""There is no risk of flight,"" he said.In the indictment unsealed this week, the defendants are accused of putting financial needs ahead of patients' needs. In some instances, patients were given excessive doses of medicine such as morphine to justify the higher level of care, which came with higher Medicare payments.Some people died because of those overdoses, according to the indictment.Rosen argued in court that Harris did not handle the drugs but instead is accused of aiding and abetting Novus doctors who dispensed the medication.Magistrate Judge Irma Ramirez ordered that Harris be released from custody but imposed a host of conditions. Among them, Harris is no longer allowed to be employed or associated with any entity in the health care industry, she said.Read the federal indictment below:Email IconValerie Wigglesworthvwigglesworth@dallasnews.com @vlwigg Featured2020 Elections CoverageYour city's newsCoronavirus UpdatesWhat's at StakeInspired: Good newsLocal business gift cardsSchool GuideTimeless in TexasCurious TexasNewspaper ArchivesPuzzles and gamesAl Día - Noticias en Español ObituariesToday's ePaperBiden vows end to ‘unending warfare’ as lead grows in Pennsylvania, which would put him over 270 and into the White HouseWhere the Electoral College vote standsDallas County eclipses 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, adds 2 more deathsWhat you need to know about coronavirusWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows tests positive for coronavirusCrime in The NewsStay up-to-date with the crime and public safety news your neighbors are talking about.By signing up you agree to our privacy policyReal.

Sherry Ann McCormick changed her plea to guilty on Thursday on a charge of Health Care Fraud in the United States District Court, Southern District of Georgia at Statesboro, Georgia.McCormick has been a volunteer for the Barry Moore for Congress campaign and a resident of Enterprise.McCormick is a victim of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ action from July that resulted in 412 defendants across 41 federal districts.The sentencing for McCormick, who once filed multiple complaints against the City of Enterprise, has yet to be scheduled and her undisclosed bond was continued by U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood.
McCormick has recently been volunteering with fundraising efforts alongside former State Representative Barry Moore. Moore is planning to run for U.S. Representative Martha Roby’s seat next year, She has been at several political events and was pictured on social media sites sitting at the table with Moore’s wife, Heather, and others at an event at Troy University. Moore even referred to McCormick as among a “great group of friends/volunteers” on his Facebook site at a recent fundraising event.
According to a filing of Criminal Information in the United States of America vs. McCormick, between 2013 and 2015 she worked in various capacities marketing compounded pain and scar medications to physicians. She was responsible for obtaining prescriptions for compounded medication from physicians and providing them to a licensed pharmacy.


For each prescription provided by McCormick, the licensed pharmacy paid McCormick a percentage of the money paid by the beneficiaries’ health care benefit program.McCormick is said to have defrauded Medicare, Tricare, and the Federal Employee Health benefit Program of at least $500,000, according to the charge. She allegedly submitted and caused the submission of fraudulent claims for medications. Those were deemed to not have been medically necessary, nor were they prescribed by a medical doctor.McCormick is a former employee of Allcare Pharmacy of Lyons, Georgia, and the United States reached a civil settlement with that company for a total of $175,000. Allcare Pharmacy allegedly submitted claims and received payment for prescriptions and compound medications, again not medically necessary and not prescribed by a doctor.

In a news release by Allcare Pharmacy, the company said, “…recently Allcare learned that the investigation revolves around one of Allcare’s former employees – Sherry McCormick – purportedly entering into an unlawful kickback arrangement with a prescribing physician. Although Allcare did not know about this purported arrangement, nor did it have any reason to know, as soon as Allcare became suspicious of certain prescriptions sent from the physician in question, Allcare immediately terminated Ms. McCormick’s employment and ceased filling any new prescriptions from that physician.

“As outlined in the government’s press release, the government recently filed criminal charges against Sherry McCormick. Allcare plans to assist the government in any way that it can in connection with that matter. In light of the fact that Allcare’s former employee was engaged in criminal conduct that – unbeknownst to Allcare – may have resulted in unnecessary prescriptions being filled, Allcare has agreed to repay the government $175,000. While the details of the settlement are still being finalized, the settlement will not include any admission of liability on the part of Allcare, and Allcare’s ability to continue to participate in federal healthcare programs will not be affected in any way.

“Although Allcare had no knowledge of the purported kickback arrangement at issue, Allcare agreed to an amicable resolution with the government so that it could get back to business as usual, and because the cost of litigating this matter would far outweigh the settlement amount. Allcare is pleased that it is able to resolve this matter amicably and continue to serve its customers, as it has since its inception. This matter should serve as a stern warning to everyone affiliated with Allcare that Allcare takes its compliance obligations very seriously, and will simply not tolerate anyone affiliated with the pharmacy acting in any way other than in full compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations.”

Advanced Spine and Pain and Coffey Family Medical closed in August, after the government made fraud allegations against the clinics' owner, The Tennessean reports.
What you should know:
1. Easley, S.C.-based Oaktree Medical Center manages the Crossville and Oneida, Tenn.-based clinics. The government accused Oaktree and its owner, Daniel McCollum, of defrauding taxpayers by forcing unnecessary injections, drug tests and opioid prescriptions on patients.
2. Since the clinics shut down, patients have been unable to get their medical records, and former employees have not been paid.
3. Oaktree closed the two Tennessee clinics the same week it closed at least 10 clinics in North and South Carolina.
4. Mr. McCollum is also accused of using illegal kickbacks to incentivize providers to overprescribe opioids and order unnecessary medical tests.
5. A lawyer for Oaktree has denied all wrongdoing in the case.

According to the police, the 23,000 victims of the alleged scam are from Manipur, a State from where the arrested person Ningombam Raju hails.



A young man, who allegedly duped people to the tune of Rs.100 crore by promising lucrative returns on their investments, has been arrested by the Delhi police.
According to the police, the 23,000 victims of the alleged scam are from Manipur, a State from where the arrested person Ningombam Raju hails.
“Raju played a pivotal role in luring people to invest in a bogus company called Welkin Real Tech Private Limited where he was employed,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).
Mr. Yadav said the arrest was made at the instance of the Manipur police which had registered a case against Raju.
He said several persons from Delhi are involved in the scam. He, however, added that no complaint has been registered in Delhi so far against Raju or the company.
Raju had joined Welkin, a company based in Delhi and owned by Kishanveer, in 2010. The joining fee for the investors was fixed as Rs.1,500 and using one identity proof a member could invest a maximum amount of Rs.10 lakh.
“The company made a claim that the money invested by its members was being re-invested in real estate or share market,” said Mr. Yadav.
After amassing a huge amount of money from its 23,000 members/subscribers, Welkin Real Tech Pvt. Ltd. was shut down in February 2011. Following the closure, Raju remained underground for over a year only to resurface in April 2012. He later started another business.
The Manipur police, which had registered an FIR against Raju earlier this year, sent a letter to the Delhi police on December 7 informing them about his presence in and around the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border. Two days later, acting on a tip off the police arrested Raju from Kotla Mubarakpur.
Before joining Welkin, Raju had worked in several other companies including BBS (Base Business System) Marketing Limited owned by another Manipuri who allegedly used similar modus operandi to cheat people and this was where Raju allegedly learnt how multi-level marketing companies work, said the police.
Mr. Yadav added that Raju had also bought a couple of properties in Uttam Nagar in West Delhi. The Manipur police have been informed and the accused would be handed over to them in a couple of days, said Mr. Yadav.
Last month, the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police had arrested a couple for allegedly cheating over two lakh investors of Rs.500 crore on false promises of lucrative returns.

(KGO) -- Car owners, listen up. Dozens of Bay Area Jiffy Lubes and one Firestone store will have their registration suspended for five days because of accusations of fraud. They also face fines and probation under settlements that state regulators revealed today.ABC7 News was first to report on two major undercover investigations by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair.One operation focused on Jiffy Lube franchise stores owned by the Fanticola family. Agents posing as customers say they found a pattern of fraud at those stores around the Bay Area.""To try and get the vehicle and the consumer to do a repair on the car that wasn't even necessary,"" said Pat Dorais with the California Bureau of Automotive Repair.RELATED: Agents allege pattern of fraud at dozens of Bay Area Jiffy LubesState documents show the stores sold a range of unnecessary services, adding as much as $240 to the bill.Under a settlement with the state, 31 Fanticola-owned Jiffy Lubes, including stores in eight Bay Area counties, will be suspended for five days.That means they can only perform minor services not regulated by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair.The Fanticola franchise is also being fined $220,000 and will be on probation for three years.""Fraud is always a very, very big concern for the bureau because that's actual theft from consumers,"" said Bill Thomas with the Auto Repair Enforcement Division..The second undercover sting focused on Firestone stores. Agents say one at Southland Mall in Hayward tried to sell unnecessary services ranging from $70 to $2,600.The state settlement in this case also calls for a five day suspension.Twenty-one other California Firestones, including six in the Bay Area, will be on probation for two years. They were accused of selling, but not installing, important safety features on new tires.RELATED: 7 Bay Area Firestone shops accused of fraudFirestone is also being fined $83,000 to cover the cost of the investigation. All the suspensions go into effect July 14. Both Firestone and the owners of the Jiffy Lube stores declined to comment on the settlements.We did receive a statement saying the Fanticolas are in ongoing discussions with the bureau about the allegations.The statement from Fanticola operated Jiffy Lube franchise known as M.C. LLC says:""M.C., LLC is currently working with the California Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) on these pending allegations. It is premature to comment on the matter further because the discussions are ongoing.""Bridgestone, the company that owns Firestone, refused to do an interview - but sent the following statement:""Bridgestone Retail Operations owns and operates more than 2,200 tire and automotive service centers nationwide. Each day, our 23,000 employees work hard to earn the trust and loyalty of our customers. At Bridgestone, we have no greater business objective than to ensure our customer interactions are guided by honesty and integrity.""""Bridgestone was notified by the California Bureau of Automotive Repairs (""BAR"") as to certain deficiencies found to exist at some of our Firestone Complete Auto Care locations. In response, Bridgestone immediately launched an extensive internal investigation and shared our findings with BAR. Bridgestone subsequently implemented appropriate corrective actions and refined operational processes, including additional training for our employees, in an effort to continuously improve the level of service we provide to our customers in California and nationwide.""""We are grateful for the guidance provided by BAR and the opportunity to address the deficiencies. Bridgestone is pleased to report that all of the Firestone Complete Auto Care locations in question are operating in full compliance with BAR requirements and guidelines.""The state documents involved can be found by clicking here.Written and produced by Jennifer Olney.

CenturyLink's CEO Glen Post addressed the elephant in the room right away during the company's second quarter 2017 earnings call on Wednesday evening: pending litigation.
Last month CenturyLink was accused of conducting unfair and fraudulent billing practices when a former employee filed a wrongful termination lawsuit after being fired. The following week, a class-action suit was filed against CenturyLink seeking damages as high as $12 billion for its consumer customers.
""I want to be very clear, the allegations contained in the lawsuits are contrary to everything I believe we stand for, and does not represent our principles [or] our values,"" Post said.

CenturyLink's 25-year CEO said that the carrier is taking these allegations very seriously, and stressed that it has pointed a special committee to conduct an independent investigation. Post doesn’t expect this review to wrap up until Q4.
""Sometimes we do make mistakes just like anyone else … whatever is found in the investigation of these matters, we will do the right thing,"" Post said.
CenturyLink announced a slew of leadership changes in June, which Post also addressed during the call. He confirmed that he  still plans on stepping down in 2019, and Level 3 Communications' current president and CEO Jeff Storey will become CEO of the newly-combined company. The companies still expect the $34 billion acquisition of Level 3 to be completed by the end of September.
June proved to be a busy month CenturyLink, which revealed that the freshly-merged company will be organized into five business units, including strategic enterprise; federal government and state government; global accounts management and international;  small and midsize business, and local government and education; wholesale and indirect; and consumer. Moreover, each president overseeing the new business units will be naming their leadership team, which could include a change to CenturyLink's current channel leadership lineup.
Overall, CenturyLink's Q2 financials were heavily impacted by one-time charges related to the sale of the data centers and colocation business, according to the Monroe, La.-based carrier.
Enterprise revenues declined 9 percent to $2.22 billion from $2.43 billion in the year ago quarter, which the provider attributed to revenue reduction associated with the sale of its data center assets, as well as a decline in legacy IT revenues.
The bright spot in CenturyLink's business segment was within its enterprise strategic services unit, which includes high-bandwidth data services, managed services, and SD-WAN packages. Strategic enterprise service revenues grew 5 percent year-over-year.

Post said that CenturyLink is also seeing growth in the small to midsized business (SMB) space. CenturyLink added more than 2,000 new MPLS customers during the quarter, with the majority being SMB customers.
In a move to capture more of this business segment, CenturyLink on Monday rolled out a new Business VoIP service. The pre-configured CenturyLink Business VoIP for small businesses offer a CenturyLink-managed voice service a flat monthly rate for customers. The service is not yet available through channel partners, but CenturyLink expects to extend the offering to its partner base in 2018, a spokesperson for the provider told CRN.
Consumer revenues declined 6.2 percent to $1.40 billion during the quarter, due to declining legacy voice revenues and lower broadband and video revenues. David Cole, CenturyLink's executive vice president of operations support and controller, said that those numbers are being driven by increased cable competition and the impact of the restructuring of a satellite video contract during Q1.
For the quarter that ended June 30, operating revenues in the second quarter were $4.09 billion, a decline of 7 percent compared to $4.40 billion in the year-ago quarter. Like in its enterprise segment, Cole attributed the drop to declining legacy revenues and revenue reduction due to its colocation sale.
The carrier earned $0.03 diluted earnings per share compared to $0.36 per share a year ago. CenturyLink said that its colocation sale impacted its earnings per share by $0.21. Net income for the quarter was $17 million, a decline of 91 percent compared to $196 million during the second quarter of 2016. Net income was also negatively impacted by approximately $115 million because of one-time charges related to its colocation sale, CenturyLink said.

MyPayrollHR based in Clifton Park closed suddenly in September 2019.Michael Williams / Albany Times Union


ALBANY — An associate of MyPayrollHR CEO Michael Mann pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, admitting he worked with Mann to defraud two finance companies out of nearly $13 million during a six-year long scheme, according to federal prosecutors.

Court documents in the case against Luke Steiner, 31, give new insight into how Mann allegedly orchestrated a years-long, multi-million-dollar bank fraud scheme that ultimately led to the collapse of his Clifton Park payroll company. Authorities said Steiner admitted that between 2013 and 2019, he helped Mann ""and others known and unknown"" conspire to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars in loans for Mann's companies.

Mann has not yet entered a plea to the bank fraud charge he faces. So far, Mann and Steiner are the only people the government has publicly accused of taking part in the scheme.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Barnett of the Northern District of New York declined to comment when asked whether the reference to other individuals in the announcement about Steiner's plea indicated additional charges could be filed against more people connected to the collapse of Mann's company.
Steiner, of Minneapolis, was an employee of Optum, a division of UnitedHealth Group Inc. One of Mann's companies, ValueWise Corp., performed consulting services for Optum and UnitedHealth until about May 2017.

While ValueWise and Optum had a business relationship, Mann allegedly orchestrated the scheme by falsely claiming that some of his other companies, including FocalPointe Group, LLC, and Weitz & Associates, Inc., were owed money by Optum.
""The object of the conspiracy was to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars in loans from financing companies ... by falsely representing that fictitious invoices from companies owned and controlled by Mann were legitimate and payable by Optum/(UnitedHealth),"" authorities wrote in court documents.
Prosecutors said Steiner, acting in his role as an employee of Optum, ""regularly represented to the financing companies that the false invoices submitted by Mann were due and payable by Optum/UHG, when, as Steiner then well knew, the invoices were false.""

In return for his role in the scheme, authorities said Steiner was paid by Mann in more than $11,000 worth of Amazon gift cards. The two finance companies — one based in New York and the other based in Colorado — were not named by authorities.

The case against Steiner appears to be just one thread of the massive $70 million bank fraud scheme Mann is alleged to have to have committed for at least a decade until early September of last year. Authorities said Mann admitted during an FBI interview that he created several companies with no other purpose than to be used in the fraud, and wrote checks to and from his various bank accounts using money he did not have.
In an attempt to alleviate debts owed to his bank, Mann allegedly poured about $36 million into his personal bank account — funds that his legitimate payroll company, MyPayrollHR, was supposed to disburse to its clients. That decision, authorities claim, was the start of a process that culminated in the company's collapse, leaving thousands of workers across the country with missing or reversed paychecks.
Mann's lawyer, Michael Koenig, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday, nor did James C. Knox, Steiner's lawyer. A message left on Steiner's cell phone was not returned.

Optum/UnitedHealth said it was cooperating with the investigation, but declined further comment.
In October 2014, Steiner received an email from a representative of one of the bilked finance companies asking for confirmation of a $4.6 million invoice showing payment by one of Mann's companies to Optum/UnitedHealth.

Minutes later, Steiner forwarded the email to Mann with the message, ""FYI."" Mann responded by sending Steiner a fraudulent confirmation message that Steiner pasted into his response to the finance company.
Another email chain showed that Mann was apparently still invested in the scheme just a week before MyPayrollHR's collapse. On Aug. 27, 2019, Steiner received a message from the same finance company, this time with a $3.6 million invoice from a Mann company to Optum/UnitedHealth. A day later, Steiner alerted Mann about the invoice.
""This looks good,"" Mann responded. Steiner then sent an email to the finance company fraudulently confirming the invoice.
Steiner faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and up to three years of supervised release once he's sentenced by Senior U.S. District Judge Lawrence E. Kahn, authorities said. Steiner is scheduled to be sentenced on May 27.

He's required to pay a total of $12,986,505.22 to the two finance companies.
He will also be required to forfeit the $11,300 — the same amount he received from Mann in Amazon gift cards.

Juan F. Gutierrez, 23, with a last known address of Home Street in the Bronx, NY, was arrested on Jan. 11, 2017, for identity fraud, fraudulent use of a credit card, and resisting arrest. Editor's Note: This post was derived from information supplied by the Merrimack Police Department. It does not indicate a conviction. This link explains the name removal request process for NH Patch police reports. At just before 5 p.m., officers were sent to the New Hampshire State Liquor and Wine Outlet on Dobson Way for a report of two men attempting to purchase alcohol with possibly stolen credit cards. Store employees were alerted about another store that may have been victimized earlier in the day, according to police, and had a Hyundai Santa Fee with a New York plate as a possible suspect vehicle. Subscribe As the first officer arrived, according to Lt. Dean KillKelley of the Merrimack Police Department, the Santa Fe was spotted leaving the area quickly. One of the suspects – Gutierrez – was still in the store, according to police, while other officers attempted to find the Santa Fe. ""Officers asked Gutierrez for identification,"" KillKelley alleged, ""(and) he provided the officer with a Pennsylvania driver's license which had Gutierrez's photo. When officers did a license check using the driver's license number, the name and address of another person, other than Gutierrez, came back.""Subscribe Officers alleged that Gutierrez also allegedly had several Visa debit/gift cards in his possession at the time and was reportedly attempting to purchase more than $400 of alcohol.  ""As the officer was attempting to arrest and handcuff Gutierrez, he resisted by pulling away,"" according to police.  Gutierrez was held on $10,000 cash bail and arraigned on Jan. 12.  During the process of arresting Gutierrez, a Brookline resident contacted police to let them know that his credit card company had informed him about a fraudulent purchase at the store.  ""Upon checking the store records and surveillance video it showed another male subject who was with Gutierrez had just used the card for a purchase and left the store prior to the officer's arrival,"" KillKelley alleged.

Grimm, Staten Island Lawmaker, Is Charged With Fraud  - The New York Times

Grimm of Staten Island; Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn; and George Venizelos, an F.B.I. assistant director, discussed the congressman’s indictment.CreditCredit...Anthony Lanzilote for The New York TimesBy Stephanie CliffordApril 28, 2014For more than two years, federal investigators delved into the background of Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island now in his second term. They looked into his campaign finances, and examined the potential mob ties of one business associate and the illegal doings of another. On Monday, Mr. Grimm was indicted in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, but the charges arose not from his career in Congress, but from his earlier one — as a health-food restaurateur.In a 20-count indictment, Mr. Grimm was accused of underreporting wages and revenue while running an Upper East Side restaurant, essentially keeping two sets of records. The fraudulent records, prosecutors said, went to his accountant, leading to inaccurate tax forms being filed with the government.Prosecutors say that Mr. Grimm concealed more than $1 million in gross receipts for the restaurant, and failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in employee wages, thus fraudulently lowering his federal and state tax payments. According to the indictment, unsealed on Monday, he also lied under oath in a deposition taken in January 2013, while he was a member of Congress.Mr. Grimm was charged with, among other things, perjury, wire fraud, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, employment of illegal immigrants, obstructing and impeding tax laws, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.Mr. Grimm, 44, is a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and Marine who emphasized his upright image while he ran for Congress, where he represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn. He surrendered to F.B.I. agents early on Monday, and pleaded not guilty in court later in the day.He was released on $400,000 bail, secured by his house on Staten Island, and left the courthouse saying he would return to work and to his campaign for a third term.ImageRepresentative Michael G. Grimm on Monday after pleading not guilty to charges that included perjury, wire and mail fraud and obstruction of justice.Credit...Anthony Lanzilote for The New York Times“After two and a half years of just being deluged and bombarded with allegation after allegation after allegation, I haven’t been able to fully defend myself,” Mr. Grimm said at a news conference after his arraignment. While he declined to comment on the charges, he said he would “fight tooth and nail” against them.Mr. Grimm also informed the House speaker, John A. Boehner, that he was stepping aside from his position on the Financial Services Committee. A spokesman for the speaker said Mr. Boehner believed that the move was “appropriate under the circumstances.”The indictment creates potential problems for the Republican Party, which has backed Mr. Grimm, the only Republican in the New York City delegation, in his bid for a third congressional term this November against the Democratic challenger, Domenic M. Recchia Jr. The deadline to turn down his party’s nomination passed two weeks ago, meaning that Mr. Grimm is highly likely to stay on the ballot no matter what happens with the federal case.Though the investigation, by the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York and the F.B.I., began by focusing on fund-raising, it took a turn midcourse to focus on the restaurant. Two fund-raisers on Mr. Grimm’s campaign have been charged: Diana Durand of Houston, who was accused of illegally giving more than $10,000 to his campaign, and Ofer Biton, who was being investigated to determine whether he had helped Mr. Grimm get around campaign-donation limits. Mr. Biton has pleaded guilty to visa fraud charges.Mr. Biton and another man, Wayne Muratore, a certified public accountant from Brooklyn, were involved in both Mr. Grimm’s 2010 campaign and his restaurant business, providing a possible link that could have turned investigators from looking at the campaign to looking at Healthalicious. Mr. Muratore has not been charged.Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, did not detail why the investigation had changed. “Whenever there’s an investigation into someone’s business activities, it is usually very broad-reaching,” she said, adding that a larger investigation was continuing.But, she said, Mr. Grimm had a sophisticated understanding of the law and finance, thanks in part to his background as an F.B.I. agent, where he did undercover work on Wall Street.An F.B.I. assistant director, George Venizelos, said revisiting Mr. Grimm’s F.B.I. work, given the charges, is “something we definitely will look at.”ImageLoretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, at a news conference announcing the 20-count indictment against Mr. Grimm.Credit...Andrew Burton/Getty ImagesAt the heart of Mr. Grimm’s indictment was a “very simple scheme,” Ms. Lynch said. After leaving the F.B.I. in 2006, Mr. Grimm opened Healthalicious, a salad-and-wrap restaurant on Second Avenue near East 83rd Street.Between 2007 and 2010, the indictment says, Mr. Grimm paid “a significant portion” of employees’ wages in cash, with many workers receiving about half their pay through direct deposit or check, and the other half in cash. He kept two sets of payroll records, and concealed the electronic spreadsheets that detailed what he was actually paying from payroll-processing companies and an accountant, the indictment says. That led to the payroll companies’ inadvertently filing erroneous tax forms, since the forms were based on the fake records.In some cases, the indictment says, Mr. Grimm paid employees entirely in cash so that the payroll processors had no records of those workers at all.The indictment describes how, from March 2010 to June 2010, Mr. Grimm sent emails to the restaurant manager that had “excerpts from the second set of payroll records, detailing how much cash each Healthalicious employee should receive for a particular week.” Those emails, as well as the mailed tax returns that were said to be based on inaccurate information, resulted in the wire and mail fraud charges.The concealment, perjury and obstruction of justice charges come in connection with a January 2013 deposition given by Mr. Grimm as part of a lawsuit by two former Healthalicious employees who accused  him of not paying them minimum wages or overtime.The indictment accuses Mr. Grimm of lying under oath about whether he paid employees in cash, whether he corresponded through an email account regarding the Healthalicious business, and whether he still had access to such an account.Speaking after his arraignment, Mr. Grimm described the investigation as a “vendetta” and a “witch hunt” meant to “assassinate my character and remove me from office.” “I will not abandon my post,” he said, “and then, on top of all that, I have an election to win.”Mr. Grimm’s comments came after a brief, but bizarre, chase scene outside court. His lawyers, Elizabeth S. Kase and John L. Kase of Kase & Druker, had indicated he would talk to the news media, but when the congressman left the courthouse, he ignored dozens of cameras and the shouts of reporters, and walked away.Mr. Grimm would be talking in 15 minutes, the lawyers explained, but at a location of their making: a lectern they had set up in front of a nearby veterans’ plaza, the lectern decorated with the Great Seal of the United States.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions

This included posting misleading job ads, such as for mystery shopper positions, that were not valid job opportunities.  The defendants are alleged to have conspired to pose as employers of these fraudulent job opportunities to lure victims, who resided throughout the United States and Canada.Authorities say the suspects obtain fake driver's licenses and money orders, which were shipped into the U.S.  The counterfeited money orders were shipped to co-conspirators, who then mailed them to unwitting victims who were under the mistaken belief that they were fulfilling the job duties of mystery shopper positions.  The victims were instructed to deposit the counterfeit money orders and securities, mailed as payment for the mystery shopper jobs, into personal bank accounts and send a portion of the monies to the alleged scam artists. That would be the last they heard from the so-called headhunters.Authorities may have become wise to alleged scheme in July, 2016 when Gibson was stopped for speeding in Dallas. According to police records obtained by the I-Team, officers found ""86 fake Tennessee drivers licenses"" in Gibson's car.Investigators said that the licenses had Gibson's picture on them with different names and addresses and were found ""in the floorboard of the car behind the passenger seat.""This case was sealed late last year by a federal judge as customs and homeland security agents rounded up those charged.Nigeria has long been a hotbed for financial scams targeting Americans. The I-Team reported more than 20-years ago on bank fraud schemes being run out of Nigeria...first by letters in the mail, then over fax machines and lately by email and text messages.

2nd UPMC radiologist accused of healthcare fraud after illegally prescribing Vicodin to non-patients



















































One month after initial allegations, the second half of a UPMC radiology duo accused of prescribing illegal painkillers to patients is facing federal charges of healthcare fraud, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported this week.
Marios Papachristou, 43, has been accused of 46 counts of illegal distribution of Vicodin. He allegedly wrote the scripts for two patients who had no medical need for the drugs but were linked to Papachristou and UPMC radiologist Omar Almusa, who was indicted earlier this month on 88 similar counts.
Papachristou has also been charged with fraud after reportedly submitting false bills to UPMC Health Plan to cover the costs of the unlawful prescriptions.
Both men were charged by UPMC police on March 1 of this year after a Feb. 15 complaint, the Post-Gazette wrote. They were promptly fired.
Though Papachristou’s legal team declined to comment on the case, Papachristou is expected to waive grand jury indictment and plead guilty May 3 before U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab.

 Sukesh Chandrasekar, the ‘middleman’ arrested in the Dinakaran bribery case, outside the police station in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, Monday (Express/Tashi Tobgyal )
A decade ago, when he was a 16-year-old schoolboy in Bengaluru, Sukesh Chandrasekar, who was crazy about cars, used to carry a forged letter from the police commissioner stating that the teenager had permission to drive cars and motorcycles at “full throttle’’ in the state of Karnataka, say policemen familiar with the crime graph of cheating and fraud charted by the youth.
Chandrasekar, 26, allegedly acted as the middleman for AIADMK leader T T V Dinakaran, who reportedly tried to bribe an Election Commission official to obtain the party’s two-leaves poll symbol for the Sasikala faction. Arrested in Delhi on Monday, Chandrasekar is a well-known trickster with a decade-long history of crime, replete with cases of fraud. Chandrasekar’s crime graph for cheating and fraud since 2007 has spanned the cities of Bengaluru, Chennai, New Delhi and Mumbai. He has been arrested several times, but has returned to crime each time after being released on bail, shifting cities and changing his modus operandi.
Prior to his arrest on Monday, he was arrested on charges of cheating in Bengaluru in 2007, 2009 and 2011, in Kolkata in 2013 for a case in Chennai, and in Mumbai in 2015. There are 15 cheating and fraud cases against him at present. Between 2007 and 2013, there were a dozen cases against Chandrasekar alias Balaji alias Sekar Reddy for posing as a relative of top politicians to con businessmen of as much as Rs 30 crore.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
According to police records, he has posed as the grandson of DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi, as the son of former union minister T R Baalu, former Tamil Nadu finance minister K Anbazhagan, former Karnataka minister Karunakara Reddy, former Karnataka chief secretary Sudhakar Rao, as the nephew of former Andhra chief minister Y S Rajashekhar Reddy and as the secretary of former Karnataka chief minister B S Yeddyurappa.
However, the cases that have given Chandrasekar his notoriety are a couple of frauds he carried out in Chennai and Mumbai between 2013 and 2015, in alleged connivance with his long-time associate and fiancee, actress Maria Leena Paul, who has appeared in films like Madras Cafe.
Chandrasekar and Paul were arrested in Kolkata and Delhi respectively in 2013 for cheating a couple in Chennai and a branch of the Canara Bank in Chennai of Rs 19 crore, after claiming to be officials from the Karnataka government interested in a sanitary napkin dispensation machine which the couple’s firm, Future Techiniks Pvt Ltd, had pioneered.

They allegedly convinced the couple that they would be awarded a Rs 132 crore contract for dispensing sanitary napkins around Karnataka if they made an initial investment of Rs 19 crore. The couple obtained a loan from Canara Bank and transferred the funds to private accounts indicated by Chandrasekar. In June 2013, Chandrasekar and Paul were tracked to a farmhouse near New Delhi. While Paul was arrested, Chandrasekar managed to escape and was arrested a month later in Kolkata.
The Delhi Police found that the couple were paying Rs 4 lakh as monthly rent for the farmhouse, and they were in the possession of nine high-end luxury cars. Paul was released on bail a month after her arrest, and Chandrasekar was also released on bail in 2015.
In 2015, they were again arrested by the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai Police for floating a fake investment scheme and duping as many as 1,000 people of around Rs 100 crore. They were allegedly running a company called Lion Oak India, which illegally accepted cash deposits in 21 bogus schemes with the promise of huge returns. Last year, after she was released on bail in the Mumbai case, Paul claimed in press interviews that Chandrasekar was a “political strategist’’.
According to a Superintendent of Police in Bengaluru, D Devaraj, who arrested Chandrasekar in 2011 for cheating dozens of businessmen in Tamil Nadu by posing as a secretary in the then Karnataka chief minister B S Yeddyurappa’s office and promising government contracts, the youth moved his fraud operations out of Bengaluru to Mumbai and Delhi following his arrest. “He has not ventured to Bengaluru for his operations since 2011. Most of his activity has been in other states,’’ he said.
Chandrasekar’s father is a rubber contractor, part-time mechanic and automobile spare parts salesman in Bengaluru. In 2007 and 2011, both his parents were arrested in Bengaluru along with Chandrasekar for cheating people. In 2012, he is alleged to have cheated the Kerala textile firm, Emmanuel Silks, of Rs 20 lakh after promising to bring actress Katrina Kaif to attend an event. He is alleged to have first met Paul, an aspiring model who was studying to be a dentist in Bengaluru in 2011, by claiming to be a grandson of DMK’s Karunanidhi with connections in the Tamil film world.
Chandrasekar is known to be glib talker who can slip into any southern language, as well as Hindi and English. “He rarely meets his victims in person. He conducts extensive research on contracts and companies and approaches them only over the telephone,’’ said Devaraj.

Nineteen arrested for Brick Lane visa fraud

Crime, Tower Hamlets/ No Comments/




Brick Lane Mela. Pic: Boishakhi Mela Community Trust
Police in Bangladesh have arrested 19 people over allegations that they provided false statements and forged documents in support of visa applications to attend a Bengali festival in Brick Lane.
It has been disclosed that the applicants were arrested on May 24 for providing forged documentation with their business visitor visa applications to be stallholders at the London Boishaki Mela, which was which attended by thousands of people on May 20.
Bangladesh police cooperated with locally based UK Border Agency officials, in an investigation which discovered that they paid up to 10 Lak Taka (approximately £10,000) each to get forged documents such as bank statements.
The UK Border Agency in Bangladesh has an integrated fraud assessment unit, which successfully uncovers and investigates high volumes of fraud and forgery in UK visa applications.
Nick Low, British Deputy High Commissioner said: “I strongly advise anyone wanting to obtain a visa to visit the UK not to listen to agents who offer to sell forged documents and say they can guarantee a visa.”
The incident is the second of its kind in recent years relating to the Mela, a secular celebration of the Bengali New Year.  In June 2007 Tower Hamlets council chief executive Martin Smith suspended its “service level agreement” with the Baishakhi Mela Trust following allegations connected to work permits.
The Mela, which was held in the Weavers Field and Brick Lane area, is one of the East End’s most prestigious festivals but many community leaders were worried its world famous reputation was being spoiled.
Shiraj Haque, chairman of the Boishaki Community Trust defended the reputation of the event: “We delivered a Boishakhi Mela the entire community were able to enjoy, a Mela that brought people of all generations and cultures to Tower Hamlets, to celebrate Bangladeshi heritage.”
Anyone applying for a business visa to the UK needs a British based business sponsor. These come in the form of a letter from the UK business describing the work to be done.

An Indian diplomat was re-indicted Friday on US visa fraud charges that touched off an international stir after she was arrested and strip-searched last year.
The new indictment, filed Friday, essentially just reinstates the charges against the diplomat, Devyani Khobragade – charges that now arrive with her out of the country. A judge had dismissed last year’s virtually identical indictment Wednesday on diplomatic immunity grounds, but left a door open to federal prosecutors to revive the case and they suggested they would.
Khobragade’s lawyer, Daniel Arshack, had no immediate comment Friday. He said Wednesday that re-indicting his client “might be viewed an aggressive act and one that [prosecutors] would be ill-advised to pursue”.
Khobragade is back in India, and it’s unclear when, if ever, she might appear in court in New York again.
Khobragade was a deputy consul general in New York when she was arrested in December near her children’s Manhattan school. Prosecutors said she lied to the government to get her Indian housekeeper a work visa, claiming she was paying the maid $500 per month while actually paying her less than $3 per hour. She had pleaded not guilty while also arguing she was immune from prosecution.
The arrest sparked an outcry in India, particularly because of the strip-search. The US Marshals said Khobragade was treated no differently than others who are arrested, and US attorney Preet Bharara said she indeed was afforded courtesies most Americans wouldn’t get, such as being allowed to make phone calls for two hours to arrange child care and sort out personal matters.
Bharara, who is himself Indian-born, also said Khobragade wasn’t handcuffed, restrained or arrested in front of her children and was given coffee and offered food while detained.
Still, many in India saw the arrest as deeply disrespectful. Indian officials also said the housekeeper had tried to blackmail the diplomat, which the woman’s advocates disputed.
The episode roiled US-Indian relations, with India taking such steps as removing concrete traffic barriers around the US embassy and revoking diplomats’ ID cards. After being indicted, Khobragade complied with a Department of State request to leave the US, and the Indian government then asked Washington to withdraw a diplomat from the US embassy in New Delhi. The US complied.
The Indian consulate in New York did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
When Khobragade was arrested, US officials said her status as a consular officer provided immunity limited to acts performed in the exercise of official functions. She disagreed, and then, on the day before her 9 January indictment, she got a new appointment that conferred wider immunity.
US district judge Shira Scheindlin decided in a ruling Wednesday that the later appointment gave Khobragade immunity when indicted and meant that indictment had to be dismissed, without settling the question of whether the alleged crimes would have been considered “official acts” covered by the earlier, more limited immunity.
But the judge wrote that there was “no bar to a new indictment against Khobragade”, whose immunity ended when she left the country.

						From left to right, Jose Romero, Kathy Duarte, Marcus Johnson, and Mercedes Agudo are former Patton State Hospital employees arrested and charged this week in connection with a payroll fraud case at the hospital totaling more than $800,000.		

By Joe Nelson | jnelson@scng.com | San Bernardino SunOctober 8, 2014 at 11:04 p.m.Four former Patton State Hospital employees pleaded not guilty Wednesday in San Bernardino Superior Court to embezzlement and other felony charges in connection with a payroll fraud scheme that authorities say bilked taxpayers out of more than $800,000.
Former Patton payroll clerk Jose Romero, 68, of Fontana and former psychiatric technicians Mercedes Agudo, 68, of San Bernardino, Kathy Duarte, 37, of San Jacinto and Marcus Johnson, 46, of Beaumont were charged Monday with multiple felonies including misappropriation of public funds, embezzlement and grand theft.
On Tuesday, investigators from the District Attorney’s Office and Patton State Hospital police arrested Romero, Duarte and Agudo without incident and booked them into West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga. Johnson voluntarily surrendered at the jail Tuesday, authorities said.
During their arraignment Wednesday via closed-circuit television, San Bernardino Superior Court Commissioner Ronald J. Gilbert entered not-guilty pleas on behalf of the four defendants, according to minutes from the hearing posted online.


The four defendants are accused of being paid for hours they did not work . The alleged crimes occurred between Aug. 21, 2007, and March 22, 2011, and involved the theft of $804,785.08, according to the criminal complaint.
Each of the defendants is charged with three felony counts of misappropriation of public funds, embezzlement and grand theft by embezzlement
District attorney’s spokesman Christopher Lee said in a news release Wednesday that his office would not be commenting further, and that the investigation is ongoing.
The defendants will next appear in court on Oct. 17 for a pretrial hearing.
In August, the State Controller’s Office released an audit revealing that sloppy payroll practices at Patton resulted in two fraud cases in which employees were overpaid more than $900,000 over a three-year period. Unlike the district attorney’s criminal case, which alleges crimes occurring between August 2007 and March 2011, the state controller’s audit covered a period from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2013.


Patton administrators disputed the findings, saying hospital staff were already aware of the alleged fraud incidents and had reported them to the state Department of Finance. They also challenged the validity of the methodology used by auditors.
State Controller’s Office spokesman Jacob Roper could not clarify Wednesday if the audit was tied in any way to the district attorney’s criminal case or any other criminal investigation.
Ken August, spokesman for the Department of State Hospitals, did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment.

			Former Santa Clara cop charged with same workers’ comp fraud scheme as convicted deputy wife		

Kenneth Henderson accused of feigning injury to get disability retirement while bodybuilding; wife convicted of similar schemeShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)By Robert Salonga | rsalonga@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: February 4, 2020 at 2:37 p.m. | UPDATED: February 5, 2020 at 9:05 a.m.A former Santa Clara police officer has been charged with workers’ compensation fraud, based on allegations he feigned injury for a disability retirement then continued a bodybuilding regimen, much like his wife — a former county sheriff’s lieutenant who was convicted last year of similar crimes.
Kenneth Henderson, 53, of Las Vegas, is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court. Court records do not show a listed attorney for him.
“These benefits are supposed to be there for officers who are legitimately injured,” Deputy District Attorney Vonda Tracey said. “This is siphoning money away from those who have legitimate injuries, and for a lot of police departments where their city or county is self-insured, taxpayer dollars are being wasted.”
The Santa Clara Police Department declined to comment on the case. The City of Santa Clara referred this news organization’s inquiry to the district attorney’s office.


According to prosecutors, suspicion fell on Henderson when his wife, Mandy Henderson, was the subject of a county investigation in 2018 assessing whether she was faking debilitating injuries to obtain disability leave while pursuing her bodybuilding career.
Perhaps the most damning evidence against Mandy Henderson was private investigators’ surveillance video contradicting  tatements she made to sheriff’s investigators — in Las Vegas, where she relocated despite still working in Santa Clara County. She had maintained that she was in constant pain, to the point that she had her husband hold her up so she could walk, and that she spent most of her days lying on the couch.
But the surveillance video showed her working out and walking before and after that meeting with investigators, according to the investigative report. Henderson resigned from the sheriff’s office in December 2018 after she was charged with workers’ comp fraud, and later pleaded no contest to the charges. She was ordered to pay restitution and was given three years of probation.
It was after that investigation that the city of Santa Clara ordered a copy of the surveillance video, having learned that it also showed Kenneth Henderson engaged in bodybuilding workouts. He left the Santa Clara police in 2016 on a disability retirement after he claimed he injured himself while picking up a stack of five traffic cones in October 2015, according to prosecutors.
Tracey said that when authorities showed the workout footage to the doctors who signed off on Kenneth Henderson’s disability status, it resembled nothing like what they saw in person.


“He was described by one of the doctors as presenting like someone who had a stroke,” Tracey said. “He claimed he couldn’t drive and was in constant pain, and he could do work around the house and water the plants.”

Because authorities can only recover losses documented after the fraud was uncovered, Kenneth Henderson would be liable for about $30,000 in restitution if convicted on all charges.
Tracey said that from her experience, the Hendersons’ fraud cases stand out because of how they carried out the alleged ploy as a husband-and-wife tandem. But she added that the cases were typical in their choice to exaggerate their injuries, since obtaining a higher disability rating results in increased benefit payouts.

Tranberg defrauded the business for at least 15 years.Facebook ShareTwitter ShareBy 
                    Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLive
                   An ex-accounting manager who worked at Weyerhaeuser’s Springfield office has pleaded guilty to mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and tax evasion after stealing more than $4.5 million from the timber company by contracting with bogus vendors, including one in her mother’s name.Susan L. Tranberg, 61, of Eugene agreed to pay $4.6 million in restitution to the company and $807,033 to the Internal Revenue Service as part of the plea agreement announced Thursday in U.S. District Court in Eugene.She had worked for the Seattle-based company for 42 years, court records indicate.""She went to great lengths to disguise her actions and mislead her colleagues,” Oregon’s U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams said in a statement. “She then took her scheme a step further by evading paying taxes on her fraudulent gains. Her crimes reflect a complete disdain for her employer and utter contempt for her responsibilities as an American taxpayer.”Tranberg acknowledged the fraud in a signed statement to Weyerhaeuser that she wrote on Jan. 15, 2019, the day she was fired in a meeting with company officials at a hotel near the Springfield office. Weyerhaeuser filed the statement in court.“There is no (one) else to punish but ME,’’ Tranberg wrote, offering to give up her 12 weeks of banked vacation pay, retirement and 401K to try to make things right.Tranberg defrauded the business by creating fake vendors and approving payment to the vendors by forging co-workers’ signatures. She also would hack into colleagues’ computer systems without authorization or their consent, according to company officials and court records.“I have no valid reason for what has happen (sic) except I made some very bad choices,’’ Tranberg wrote to her former bosses. “I can never repair the damage I have done but hope to try to make things right. ‘’Weyerhaeuser, founded in 1900, is one of the world’s largest private owners of timberlands, owning or controlling nearly 12.4 million acres of timberlands in the United States, and one of the leading manufacturers of wood products. It employs about 100 staff in Springfield.Tranberg began working for the company on Oct. 25, 1976, and served as finance and planning manager at the Springfield office when she was fired, according to Justin Nikbakhsh, Weyerhaeuser’s vice president of financial operations.The company sometimes buys timber from third parties for its manufacturing operations and occasionally makes advance payments to those vendors, allowing them to produce timber under contract to Weyerhaeuser. Since June 2014, such payments were processed electronically.Weyerhaueser didn’t learn of Tranberg’s alleged theft until Jan. 10, 2019, when it discovered irregularities in certain advance payments to vendors in its electronic system, Nikbakhsh wrote in a sworn statement.The payments in question were made to vendors identified as M.J. Miller and Margaret J. Miller, the name of Tranberg’s mother who died in 2009, company officials said.Tranberg had created a phony contract between Weyerhaeuser and fake sellers M.J. Miller and R. J. Miller called the “Tree Farm Family Agreement,’’ which was dated June 16, 1986, according to court papers. Tranberg used her mother’s Social Security number and her own home mailing address to receive fraudulent payments made to the Millers under the fake contract, Nikbakhsh’s statement said.Weyerhaeuser never received timber under the contract but the payments to the nonexistent Millers continued for more than a decade and were pocketed by Tranberg for her personal benefit, Nikbakhsh wrote.Tranberg forged coworkers’ signatures or used their computer login credentials to approve the payments, according to the court records. Each of the payments was for less than $10,000 to avoid a further level of oversight, the records said. Tranberg also falsely indicated in the company’s electronic system that Weyerhaeuser had received timber from the Millers, company officials allegedThe company’s investigation indicates Tranberg diverted at least $4,581,218 to herself from Weyerhaeuser between 2004 and January, according to Nikbakhsh.In January 2017, Tranberg’s boss retired and she became finance and planning manager in the Springfield location, using her own credentials to approve the payments. From January 2017 to January 2019, Tranberg received another $688,475 from a bogus contract, according to Weyerhaeuser’s investigation.When sentenced, Tranberg could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. An aggravated identity theft conviction also carries a two-year mandatory minimum sentence that must be served consecutive to any other sentence.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail at mbernstein@oregonian.comFollow on Twitter @maxoregonian Visit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our   User Agreement,  Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,  and Your California Privacy Rights  (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.

(REUTERS)In an affidavit submitted to a commission of inquiry headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, Cyril Ramaphosa said that his meetings with the Gupta brothers had been 'inconsequential'.IANS Last Updated: July 27, 2019, 19:46 ISTFOLLOW US ON:FacebookTwitterInstagramTelegram Google NewsJohannesburg: South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has made public a six-page affidavit in which he detailed his meetings with the controversial Gupta brothers to the commission of inquiry investigating ""state capture"".The Indian-born Gupta brothers -- Ajay, Atul and Rajesh -- are known to be close to former South African President Jacob Zuma. His son, daughter and one of the former President's wives worked for the family's firms, according to media reports.The Gupta brothers have been accused of wielding enormous political influence in South Africa, with critics saying that they tried to ""capture the state"" to further their own business interests.The family allegedly used its relationship with Zuma to influence state contracts, Cabinet appointments and secure several lucrative deals in the country. The former President, however, claimed that he never broke the law in his dealings with the Guptas.In the affidavit submitted to the commission, headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, Ramaphosa on Friday said that his meetings with the Gupta brothers had been ""inconsequential"", South Africa's Times Live reported.Ramaphosa said he had met with two of the Gupta brothers on ""three or four occasions"".""My interactions with the Gupta brothers were at events where nothing of any consequence was discussed. I never engaged with them beyond the basic greetings, pleasantries and common courtesies.""The President said that the ""only occasion where matters of substance were discussed was when the Guptas met the African National Congress (ANC) officials to discuss their situation in relation to closure of their bank accounts and at which was also raised the controversy around them and their relationship with Zuma"", IOL News reported.Ramaphosa also detailed another instance in April 2016 when Rajesh Gupta had met him and made a presentation on the Gupta family's business model.The President said that he had also voiced concern over landing the family's private jet full of wedding guests at South Africa's National Defence Force Waterkloof Airforce Base in 2013, Business Day newspaper reported.""I stated that they had, through their actions, placed the former president in an invidious position,"" the affidavit read. ""Tony (Rajesh) Gupta's reaction was that permission for the plane to land was obtained and given by the Indian High Commissioner.""Ramaphosa's affidavit came after the commission wrote to him and all members of the Cabinet to state whether they had any meetings, or interactions or dealings with any of the Gupta brothers and if that had happened, to detail the nature of the interactions.Tags: Cyril RamaphosafraudGupta brothersSouth AfricaFirst Published: July 27, 2019, 19:46 ISTNext StoryRecommended For YouKL Rahul Shares a Sweet Birthday Wish for 'Mad Child' Athiya Shetty, See PicI-League 2020-21 to Start on January 9 in Kolkata with 11 Teams and New FormatRyanair's Savage Tweet on Eric Trump Taking 'Cheap Flights' After US Elections Sets Internet on FireKaun Banega Crorepati 12 Gets its First Crorepati in Nazia Nasim, Watch Amitabh Bachchan's ReactionThis Mashup of Avengers: Infinity War and Donald Trump, Joe Biden Sums Up US Elections 2020PhotogalleryPoonam Pandey, Sam Bombay Arrested for Allegedly Shooting 'Porn' on Goa Beach11PHOTOSA Sneak Peek at the Newly Constructed Bareilly Civil Airport; See Pics2PHOTOS Loading...

										Antioch company accused of repair fraud

Updated 5/9/2013 6:05 PM


The Illinois attorney general's office on Thursday sued an Antioch home repair company, accusing the firm of failing to complete projects and not paying its supplier.
The civil complaint against Perfect Restorations and its owners was filed in Lake County circuit court. No criminal charges have been filed.








							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
							        
	
 

Co-owners James Novack, James Hauser and Bruce Faber are named in the lawsuit, according to a news release from the agency.
When contacted by the Daily Herald, Novack said the company has had financial issues. He also said the two other owners walked out on the company they've operated for more than three years.
Contract jobs will be completed when Novack can afford to do the work, he said.
""We're not bad people,"" Novack said.
The Perfect Restorations website targets homeowners who've experienced storm damage.
According to the attorney general's office, Perfect Restorations demanded upfront installment payments ranging from $4,000 to $41,000. When the contractors did incomplete or shoddy work, the news release said, refunds were denied.
The lawsuit asks the court to ban the defendants from working in the home repair business in Illinois. It also seeks to cancel pending contracts and to obtain restitution for affected consumers.

Some homeowners had liens placed on their homes for supplies the company failed to pay for, the agency said.
Other penalties are possible, too.
Novack said he's trying to pay off the bills and make things right with customers.
""I'm trying to pay off as much as I can when I can,"" he said. ""And I am still completing work.""

Police: Three Men Arrested in Tysons Apple Store for Credit Card Fraud 


Vernon Miles
April 8, 2019 at 4:45pm





Three men were arrested in the Tysons Corner Center mall’s Apple Store last Friday (April 5) and charged with credit card fraud and theft, according to police.
The arrest took place around 1:45 p.m. after staff at the store alerted police officers to a man in the store believed to be a suspect in previous credit card fraud cases, according to a recap from the Fairfax County Police Department.
According to the police report:
Officers determined there were two other men working with the man inside the store. They were using fraudulent identification along with stolen credit cards to make purchases. Officers arrested all three men and found devices in their car used to manufacture fraudulent identification documents and credit cards. Also inside the car was approximately $50,000 worth of property. Madalin Florea, 43, of Connecticut, was charged with three counts of credit card theft, three counts of credit card fraud, three counts of larceny with intent to sell and possession of a fictitious driver’s license. Coja Ion, 60, of no fixed address, was charged with credit card theft, credit card fraud, larceny with intent to sell and possession of a fictitious driver’s license. Gabriel Balam, 29, no fixed address, was charged with credit card theft, credit card fraud, larceny with intent to sell and three counts of possession of a fictitious driver’s license.

Education Management Corporation Accused of Widespread Fraud - The New York Times

While the civil lawsuit is one of many raising similar charges against the expanding for-profit college industry, the case is the first in which the government intervened to back whistle-blowers’ claims that a company consistently violated federal law by paying recruiters based on how many students it enrolled. The suit said that each year, Education Management falsely certified that it was complying with the law, making it eligible to receive student financial aid.“The depth and breadth of the fraud laid out in the complaint are astonishing,” said Harry Litman, a lawyer in Pittsburgh and former federal prosecutor who is one of those representing the two whistle-blowers whose 2007 complaints spurred the suit. “It spans the entire company — from the ground level in over 100 separate institutions up to the most senior management — and accounts for nearly all the revenues the company has realized since 2003.”Education Management, which is based in Pittsburgh and is 41 percent owned by Goldman Sachs, enrolls about 150,000 students in 105 schools operating under four names: Art Institute, Argosy University, Brown Mackie College and South University.In a statement Monday, the company denied any wrongdoing.“The pursuit of this legal action by the federal government and a handful of states is flat-out wrong,” said Bonnie Campbell, a spokeswoman for the company’s legal counsel. “EDMC’s 2003 compensation plan followed the law in both its design and implementation, as EDMC’s response to the governments’ complaint will show.”“Federal regulations issued in 2002 permitted companies to consider enrollments in admission officer compensation, so long as enrollments were not the sole factor considered,” the statement continued. “To ensure compliance with this regulation, EDMC worked closely with outside experts in both human resources and education law to develop a plan that required consideration of five quality factors along with enrollment numbers to determine salaries.”The government’s incentive compensation ban was designed to stop companies from signing up unqualified students for their aid money. The False Claims Act, the basis for the government’s lawsuit, provides for triple damages, and since the complaint said all the government student aid came from such claims, the damages could be as much as $33 billion. As a practical matter, though, such huge cases are usually settled for far less than the maximum damages. Since 1986, the government has recovered more than $25 billion in false-claim cases, many of them based on pharmaceutical company marketing, hospitals overbilling or defense contractor fraud. Given their explosive growth, for-profit colleges — which now serve more than 10 percent of the students enrolled in higher education, yet account for about half of all defaults on student loans — could become a new prime source for such cases.According to the 122-page complaint, Education Management got $2.2 billion of federal financial aid in fiscal 2010, making up 89.3 percent of its net revenues. The states joining in the suit are California, Florida, Illinois and Indiana.The complaint said the company had a “boiler-room style sales culture” in which recruiters were instructed to use high-pressure sales techniques and inflated claims about career placement to increase student enrollment, regardless of applicants’ qualifications. Recruiters were encouraged to enroll even applicants who were unable to write coherently, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs or who sought to enroll in an online program but had no computer.According to the suit, recruiters were also led to exploit applicants’ psychological vulnerabilities — for example, a parent’s hopes of moving a child out of a dangerous neighborhood. Under the False Claims Act, individual whistle-blowers can file suits charging that the government has been defrauded, leaving the government the option to intervene. Either way, the government gets the majority of any money recovered; the whistle-blowers also get a share.The Justice Department, which has declined to intervene in two dozen whistle-blower suits charging for-profit colleges with fraudulent recruiting practices, said in May that it would act against Education Management, four years after a complaint filed by two former employees: Lynntoya Washington, an assistant director of admissions at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh Online Division, and Michael T. Mahoney, the director of training for the Online Higher Education Division.Publicly traded for-profit college companies have recently been a target both of government scrutiny and whistle-blower suits. In 2009, the Apollo Group, which owns the University of Phoenix, the largest for-profit college, settled a whistle-blower case for $78 million. The complaint noted that Todd Nelson, the chief executive of Education Management, previously headed the University of Phoenix. At Phoenix, he signed a $9.8 million settlement with the Department of Education, which had found that Phoenix had “systematically and intentionally” violated federal rules against paying recruiters for students. Phoenix never admitted any wrongdoing in either that settlement or the larger whistle-blower settlement two years ago. The Justice Department complaint said Education Management’s compensation system was similar to the one at Phoenix; company officials have said it was set up long before Mr. Nelson joined it in 2007.In 2003, Education Management’s chief executive was Jock McKernan, a former governor of Maine who now serves as chairman of the board. Mr. McKernan is married to Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican whose 2010 financial disclosure form lists Education Management stock and options worth $2 million to $10 million.

Johanne Jarlego, 44, was an accountant for a local magazine publisher. She was arrested Monday as a result of a federal indictment.     The indictment alleges between June 2008 and February 2015, she diverted $3,833,640 from magazine advertisers into a personal account. In an attempt to cover her tracks, officials say she repaid $2,428,600.     Jarlego is also accused of four counts of filing false tax returns. According to the indictment, in 2011-2014, she failed to claim the $2,688,356 obtained through her fraudulent acts as income.             She pleaded not guilty to all charges. She was able to post $50,000 bail and released.     A jury trial will be held on August 29.     If she is convicted, Jarlego could spend up to 30 years in prison, and a $1,000,000 fine for each count of bank fraud. In addition, she could also face three years behind bars, and a $250,000 fine for each count of tax fraud.     Copyright 2017 Hawaii News Now.

Sri Lankan police have detained the brother of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa on a charge of misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars in public funds.
The move comes amid an intensifying power struggle on the island nation as the Rajapaksa family moves towards launching a bid to return to power after being ousted in January in a presidential election.
Basil Rajapaksa, the former economic development minister, was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon after being questioned for more than six hours about an alleged 70m rupee (£352,000) fraud involving the construction of public housing, UR De Silva, his lawyer, said.

“We are told that he will be taken before a magistrate this evening. Since he is charged under the Offences Against Public Property Act, bail is not possible. I will be making a … submission but I am not hopeful that he will be released,” De Silva said on Wednesday.
The younger Rajapaksa, who has dual Sri Lankan-American citizenship, fled to the US soon after his brother lost the election to his former ally Maithripala Sirisena, who came to power on a pledge to fight corruption.
The former president himself is under investigation over a bribery charge and is due to be questioned by anti-graft detectives on Friday.
“They have no evidence. They are making wild allegations. This is a witch-hunt. Neither I nor any member of my family has ill-gotten money. Show us the money, where is the evidence?” Mahinda Rajapaksa said earlier this week.
The victory of Maithripala Sirisena by six percentage points in a runoff vote on 8 January was welcomed by India and western nations including the US. Analysts had described the election as the most significant in the country for decades and a last chance for democracy.
Mahinda Rajapaksa came to power in 2005, led the military to a bloody victory over violent separatists from the Tamil minority four years later and surfed a wave of popularity among the Sinhala majority to win again in 2010. He then had the constitution changed to allow the third term he hoped to win in January’s poll.
However, allegations of corruption and nepotism, violent intimidation of political opponents, attacks on journalists, growing resentment among Tamils and mounting sectarian violence led to concern at home and abroad.
The 69-year-old veteran politician still retains considerable support among Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese Buddhist majority, especially in rural areas.
Basil Rajapaksa left for the US within days of the election defeat in January. He was greeted at Sri Lanka’s international airport on Wednesday by supporters.
Speaking on his arrival, he said “the Rajapaksas have never stolen public money”.
According to his lawyer, the former minister voluntarily presented himself at the police financial crimes investigation division in Colombo, the cultural and commercial capital, at around 11am.
“We were informed around 5.30 that he was arrested. We did not have access to him while he was being questioned. But later we got to know that he had been arrested … on suspicion of misappropriation of funds in a housing project. Police say there are irregularities in payments under the project that were connected with Mr Rajapaksa as minister,” De Silva said.
Police are also investigating allegations that funds from a US$70m “livelihood development fund” were misappropriated.

David Plunkett, a 53-year-old accountant in Lynn, Mass., pleaded guilty to bank fraud this week for his part in a scheme to defraud mortgage lenders between 2006 and 2015.Plunkett also pleaded guilty to one count of aiding in the submission of false tax returns in entering his plea in Boston federal court, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts. Plunkett faces sentencing in June.Plunkett allegedly participated in a scam with co-conspirators in which people were recruited to buy residential housing using false income, employment and occupancy information when they applied for loans. The properties primarily were two- to four-unit structures located in Salem, Mass.




After the properties were purchased, the co-conspirators would convert them into condominiums and recruit more borrowers to purchase individual units using fraudulent mortgages, according to charges filed in court. Many borrowers later defaulted on their loans, costing lenders millions of dollars in losses.Plunkett pleaded guilty to assisting in the scheme by preparing tax returns with false and inflated income to help borrowers apply for loans, as well as letters that falsely represented his firm had prepared corporate tax returns for shell entities borrowers claimed were their employers.Employer fraud has been a concern in other parts of the country as well. Last year, Fannie Mae issued multiple warnings that fake employers had been discovered on several loan applications submitted to finance properties in California.Income falsification is the fastest-growing form of mortgage fraud, according to CoreLogic's latest annual fraud report. Income fraud was up 22.1% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2018, followed by occupancy fraud (up 3.5%) and schemes in which the nature of the transaction was misrepresented (up 0.6%).

The investigation encompasses at least 67 other individuals and a dozen medical equipment companies, including 6 foreign companies. The charges include conspiracy, fraud, embezzlement, bribery, forgery and performing unauthorized clinical trials. Several news reports mentioned that stents and angioplasty balloons were involved.
According to one Italian website, the investigation started in 2011 in response to allegations by a group, Amici del Cuore (Friends of the Heart), that patients at the Modena Hospital (Policlinico di Modena) received treatments and procedures as part of unauthorized experiments. In some cases the procedures may have resulted in fatal outcomes. The accused physicians ""performed experimental tests without making it known to patients for the sole purpose of writing about these trials in specialized magazines collecting money through bogus non-profit organization,"" the website reported. [All translations in this story taken from Google Translate.]
""We wanted to ask questions about certain procedures that went far beyond the standard ones, and that seemed unusual to us,"" the president of Friends of the Heart, Professor Giovanni Spinella, told Il Salvagente. ""We were aware that invasive procedures were performed, often on peripheral organs, and sometimes had little to do [with] the heart. And unfortunately had caused discomfort and damage to several patients.""
Another Italian site quoted a police official who called it ""a major operation"" and said the accused ""committed human clinical trials without authorization and installed medical devices and equipment defective in patients unaware of being subjected to an experimental treatment."" The accused physicians then ""created false medical records to cover medical errors."" The Italian media said the investigation included recordings of telephone conversations between the suspects. The Italian police named the operation camici sporchi (""dirty gowns"").

The most prominent person arrested was Maria Grazia Modena, the chief of cardiology at Modena Hospital and a former president of the Italian Society of Cardiology. (Grazia Modena was the subject of a profile in Circulation European Perspectives (PDF) in 2007.) Modena, 60 years old, was trained partly at New York University and the Mayo Clinic. The second main focus of the investigation appears to be the head of the catheterization laboratory at the hospital, Giuseppe Sangiorgi. According to news reports, he is the only arrested physician who is still in jail.
Here are the names of the nine physicians:

Maria Grazia Modena, chief of cardiology
Giuseppe Sangiorgi, head of the catheterization laboratory
Luigi Vincenzo Politi
Alessandro Aprile
Simona Lambertini
Giuseppe Biondi Zoccai
Fabrizio Clement
Alessandro Mauriello

On Thursday, Europol said that the arrests are the result of a two-year investigation between the agency, the Romanian National Police and the Italian National Police, and Eurojust.On 28 March, a series of arrests took place across Europe. In total, the raids resulted in the arrest of nine individuals from Romania and 11 in Italy, all of which are remanded in custody.Law enforcement alleges that the group used spear phishing and mass email campaigns to impersonate tax agencies. The emails were crafted to appear from legitimate sources in order to lure victims to click on malicious links which led to fraudulent websites.These domains then requested the online banking credentials of victims. When submitted, these credentials were then used by the scammers to make fraudulent transactions to bank accounts under their control.The funds, now deposited into attacker-linked accounts, were then withdrawn from Romanian ATMs.According to Europol, roughly one million euros was stolen from hundreds of customers belonging to two unnamed banks.




""The highly organized crime group (OCG) pursued its criminal activity using encrypted chat applications,"" Europol says. ""It established its power by applying intimidating and punitive methods towards affiliates and competitors. The OCG is also suspected of money laundering, drug and human trafficking, prostitution and participation in a criminal organization.""See also: Europol tracks down suspected leader of Carbanak malware campaignsEuropol has been busy. Earlier this week, the agency said the suspected leader of a criminal ring responsible for the theft of over €1 billion from financial institutions has been arrested.The suspect is believed to be behind the Carbanak and Cobalt malware campaigns which targeted over 100 financial institutions, stealing at least €10 million per successful heist.

HeldermanReporter focusing on political enterprise stories and investigations EmailEmailBioBioFollowFollowNovember 9, 2018 at 6:50 PM ESTFederal investigators last year looked into whether Matthew G. Whitaker, as an advisory board member of a Miami patent company accused of fraud by customers, played a role in trying to help the company silence critics by threatening legal action, according to two people with knowledge of the inquiry.Follow the latest on Election 2020chevron-rightWhitaker, named this week by President Trump as acting attorney general, occasionally served as an outside legal adviser to the company, World Patent Marketing, writing a series of letters on its behalf, according to people familiar with his role.But he rebuffed an October 2017 subpoena from the Federal Trade Commission seeking his records related to the company, according to two people with knowledge of the case.ADThe FTC alleged in a 2017 complaint that the company bilked customers with fraudulent promises that it would help them market their invention. The FBI has also investigated World Patent Marketing, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.ADWhitaker was not named in the FTC complaint. World Patent Marketing, without admitting fault, settled the case for more than $25 million earlier this year, according to court documents.Justice Department officials declined to comment on Whitaker’s handling of the FTC subpoena.In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker has said he was not aware of any fraudulent activity. Any stories suggesting otherwise are false.”Before he led the Justice Department, Matthew G. Whitaker promoted company accused of deceiving clientsWhitaker’s connection to World Patent Marketing came as a surprise to both senior Justice Department and White House officials, several officials said.ADIn their investigation, FTC staff had sought to learn more about the role played by the company’s advisory board members, including Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney whose role was prominently highlighted by the company in news releases and marketing materials.ADThe company said the board would help review inventors’ ideas to maximize their ability to get rich, according to promotional materials and former customers.In truth, the board did not meet and rarely reviewed inventors’ ideas, according to court documents.Whitaker, however, appeared to act at times as an attorney for the company, according to people with knowledge of his role.Whitaker has told officials he served in a limited capacity as an outside legal adviser to the company and provided occasional advice when asked but that he was not part of the day-to-day operations, according to a Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.ADWhen the FTC subpoenaed Whitaker for his records related to the company in October 2017, he failed to provide any information, telling investigators that he was busy at that time moving from Iowa to Washington for a new job, according to people with knowledge of the case.ADAt the time, Whitaker was preparing to assume a new post: chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Another advisory board member who also did legal work for the company, New York-based attorney Eric Creizman, said he also received a subpoena from the FTC and turned over records regarding the company.“I thought you kind of had to respond to subpoenas,” he said. “If you’re busy, that doesn’t give you the right to avoid a subpoena.”ADIn the end, FTC investigators did not obtain evidence or internal communications showing Whitaker knew about the company’s phony promises to help investors patent and market their ideas, according to people with knowledge of the case.This week, court receiver Jonathan Perlman, who oversaw details of the settlement, told The Washington Post that he has “no reason to believe that [Whitaker] knew of any of the wrongdoing.”ADWithin a few months of issuing the subpoena to Whitaker, the FTC began settlement discussions with World Patent Marketing and its chief executive, Scott Cooper.On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI had opened a criminal investigation into World Patent Marketing, publishing an email that one victim of the company had received from a victim specialist for the bureau.ADThe July 2017 email indicated that the FBI was investigating the matter at that time, along with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and invited the person to call a hotline to discuss their experiences with the company.Spokesmen for the U.S. attorney’s office in Miami and the FBI’s Miami Field Office declined to comment.In the probe of the company, FTC investigators concluded World Patent Marketing actively “suppressed” complaints about the company through “threats, intimidation and gag clauses,” according to a news release by the agency.ADThey noted that Cooper used the threat of legal action as a cudgel to prevent customers from posting negative reviews online or complaining to the Better Business Bureau.ADOne customer who persisted with filing a complaint with the bureau was sent an email by one of Cooper’s lawyers accusing her of engaging in activity that could subject her to a “federal extortion charge,” noting the felony is punishable by two years in prison, according to the FTC complaint.Neither Cooper nor his current attorney responded to requests for comment.In one August 2015 email contained in court filings, Whitaker threatened one of the company’s critics, emphasizing that he was a former U.S. attorney.In response to a man who had complained to Cooper about the company and threatened to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Whitaker warned “there could be serious and criminal consequences” if he proceeded. Whitaker noted his previous role as the top federal prosecutor in southern Iowa and included an image of his law firm’s logo.Four days after Whitaker’s email, the company filed a lawsuit against the man in New York, alleging he had defamed Cooper and attempted to extort him. The company’s suit noted that Whitaker had intervened in the matter at Cooper’s personal request.The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2016.Alice Crites, Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.comment0 CommentsToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyToday’s HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyAbout UsPublic RelationsCareersDiversity & InclusionNewspaper in EducationToday's PaperWP BrandStudioEventsPolicies & StandardsGet The PostHome DeliveryDigital SubscriptionGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & eBookse-ReplicaHelpContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareReader RepresentativeAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2020 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2020 The Washington PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices

VIDEO: Ex-attorney pleads guilty in 'largest fraud' in state history

Kevin Lewis, left, stays silent as reporters pepper him with questions Wednesday. Lewis was leaving the U.S. District Courthouse in Little Rock after pleading guilty to a crime prosecutors called the worst fraud in state history.
(
Gavin Lesnick)




LITTLE ROCK — A former Little Rock attorney has pleaded guilty to a scheme that prosecutors are calling the largest fraud in the history of Arkansas.
Kevin Lewis, 43, plead guilty to selling or using as collateral approximately $50 million in fraudulent bonds. 



Lewis pleads guilty in 'largest fraud' ever in Ark.

Watch Video


Lewis will be sentenced at a later date but he could face up to 30 years in prison and be ordered to pay restitution of nearly $40 million. Lewis, who was allowed to remain free pending sentencing, did not comment as he left the courthouse beside his attorney.
Prosecutors said Lewis sold fraudulent special improvement district bonds to First Southern Bank in Batesville and then used the proceeds to buy a controlling interest in that bank and make other fraudulent investments.
""Essentially, Mr. Lewis was operating what is commonly called a Ponzi scheme,"" U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas Christopher Thyer said during a news conference after the plea. ""... He used much of these loan proceeds to further the fraud and he also used these proceeds to fund various businesses which he was involved with as well as to lead what can only be described as very opulent lifestyle.""
The fraud, which was discovered during a routine audit by the FDIC in October 2010, forced First Southern Bank into receivership and caused a ""significant loss"" for many others, Thyer said. Prosecutors say Centennial Bank, Citizens, Liberty Bank, First Community, Allied, Simmons and Regions Bank also provided loans to Lewis which were backed by fraudulent bond collateral.
Thyer twice called it the largest fraud ever in the state, noting civil lawsuits will likely continue for years to come but there will never be enough money collected from Lewis to repay all the victims.
The number of victims ""goes way up,"" Thyer said, if you consider the individuals affected by the bank loss, such as First Southern Bank shareholders. At least five lawsuits have already been filed by Arkansas banks against Lewis.
While Lewis could be sentenced up to 30 years in prison by U.S. District Judge James Moody, it's unlikely he will receive that much prison time. Thyer said sentencing guidelines - which take into account past criminal convictions and other factors - indicate a likely sentence of 10 to 13 years.
No sentencing date was set, but such hearings often occur within about 90 days of a conviction.
Lewis spoke during the hearing Wednesday before Moody, but only to acknowledge he understood his rights, was aware of the maximum prison term and that he was pleading guilty to the crimes as alleged by prosecutors. 
At one point, Moody asked if Lewis understood that his plea made him a felon, a status which prevents him from certain rights and licenses.
""Regrettably, yes sir,"" Lewis replied.

@KatOne: I'm sure he had already been charged and posted bond; if he was gonna flee, he'd be gone by now. Besides, since it's Federal charges extradition won't be an issue if he leaves the state, and I'm sure his passport if any has been seized (if not revoked) so he can't leave the country.

It is high time that people that cause economic ruin to folks get a sentence fitting the damage they do.. Hold up a convience store and geta couple of hundred dollars.. get 20 years.. rob others with a pen and ink.. probably get 5 years.. these scumbags should be executed..$50,000,000 ? lets see.. that the equivalent to 500,000.. that's five hundred thousand $100 holdups.. how many did this pissant ruin..Life withi=out parole would be fitting.. But.. he is a LAWYER and wears a SIUT.. just shows the difference in treatment that well-healed perps get..

Believe J.R. Hodges of Little Rock still holds the state's fraudster title at some $500 million, He walked in a bankruptcy in the 80s but others, including a S&L guy, fell.

Remember the man and wife team that frauded a bank in Little Rock either in the late 80's or early 90's. I think it was First Commercial. Whatever was down in the building on the corner across from what use to be the TCBY Tower. I think she was blonde-headed. They both got sent to federal prision in Texas I believe. I wonder if they're still serving time??

There is a lot I can say about this particular lawyer, without even having met him. So I will reserve comment. But I have noticed, after having dealt with a number of them, is that they all have the same predatory aims. Lawyers all believe they are smarter than the 75% of the remaining, that are not lawyers.

I went to school with Kevin from 4th-12th grades. He was an arrogant prick back then and apparently still is. He never had many friends in school because he thought his sh!t didnt stink. I hope he gets the max sentence.

Rochester man pleads guilty to federal wire fraud charges
 







					Steven Spearie The State Journal-Register   @stevenspearie
				



Sunday
Jul 26, 2020 at 2:22 PM







A Rochester man pleaded guilty last week to federal charges claiming he operated a medical equipment reseller business that defrauded more than $250,000 from various other businesses.Chase Brown, 20, pleaded in guilty to two counts of wire fraud and one count of device fraud before U.S. Magistrate Judge Tom Schanzle-Haskins.Brown was arrested in March and is detained.Brown will be sentenced before U.S. District Judge Richard Mills on Dec. 3.According to a press release, Brown admitted that he established a business known as Midwest Surgical, LLC, in May 2019, purportedly to engage in the purchase and resale of medical equipment.As part of the scheme, Brown applied for an aviation credit card in December 2018. In the application, Brown falsely stated that Midwest’s annual revenue was more than $18 million and that it employed 26 employees. After obtaining the credit card, Brown incurred more than $200,000 in charges for fuel, private charter flights and plane maintenance, including approximately $4,500 from an aviation company in Springfield.Brown admitted that he repeatedly made false promises and representations to persons and businesses throughout the country that he would buy or sell medical equipment that he had no intention or ability to sell or purchase. After falsely representing that he would sell medical equipment, Brown used the buyers’ credit card information for personal purchases for himself and one or more of his friends but never provided the equipment to the buyer,The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General and the Springfield Police Department conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy A. Bass represents the government in the prosecution.Brown is facing 30 years behind bars for wire fraud and 10 years for access device fraud.Contact Steven Spearie: 622-1788, sspearie@sj-r.com, twitter.com/stevenspearie.

BATON ROUGE - A Baton Rouge contractor, with prior arrests for contractor fraud, is accused of failing to perform agreed upon work after receiving $33,050 from a homeowner. 
Police say Laroy Turnipseed Sr. received payment to perform repairs on a flood victim's home in November of 2016. Over a three-month period, the victim saw little work being done to the residence. The victim says Turnipseed stopped showing up to the house all together and stopped responding to the victims phone calls and emails by January of 2017.
Officers observed that the resident's floors had become bare, with unfinished concrete slabs, and that there were large openings in the victims walls with weeds growing inside. 
Turnipseed is accused of misapplication of payments and residential contractor fraud. 
Police say Turnipseed has previous arrests for simple criminal damaged to property and contractor fraud, as well as multiple felony thefts.

By Jonathan Stempel


(Reuters) - A New York City hedge fund manager who allegedly faked his own death to conceal his fraud was convicted on Friday for stealing more than $800,000 from investors he solicited, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Friday.Moazzam Ifzal ""Mark"" Malik, 33, from Lahore, Pakistan, was convicted on all 28 counts he faced, including grand larceny and securities fraud, after a 2-1/2-week trial in the state supreme court in Manhattan.Malik faces up to 20 years in prison at his scheduled Dec. 18 sentencing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against him in February.Authorities said Malik from 2011 to 2015 lured investors to hedge funds under the names Wall Street Creative Partners, Seven Sages Capital, American Bridge Investments and most recently Wolf Hedge, claiming that he invested more than $100 million and routinely generated market-beating returns.


But according to Schneiderman, Malik never had more than $90,000 in his brokerage accounts, and spent much of what he raised on hotels, plane tickets, meals, a karaoke bar and other personal items.The SEC alleged that Malik went so far in September 2013 as to create an employee named ""Courtney"" who emailed an investor seeking to redeem his money to say there would be a delay because Malik had died of a heart attack.Richard Verchick, a lawyer for Malik, in an interview said he was not surprised by the verdict, which followed a day of jury deliberations.He said he had argued in court that it was difficult to know the ""conscious purpose or objective"" behind Malik's actions.


""He believed in his mind and in his heart that he was not guilty,"" Verchick said.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by James Dalgleish)

CAPE TOWN - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) on Thursday said police arrested nine people suspected of being involved in fraudulent and corrupt practices at the Gugulethu payout point.Authorities swooped on the premises following several complaints from the public that some beneficiaries were forced to hand over cash to corrupt officials.The agency has been working countrywide in a bid to clamp down on corrupt officials and money lenders who prey on victims at payout points.Officials will be thoroughly examining the Gugulethu payout point and questioning various staff members during the lockdown.Sassa's Frank Earl confirmed four employees and five touts are facing fraud and corruption charges.Two of the employees involved had already been suspended a while ago.Earl said some employees divulged personal information to touts who would then strong-arm beneficiaries to hand over cash.""The staff was colluding with the public in general to be able to access disability grants and they would share the proceeds of the grant once it has been processed.""Sassa said some officials also allegedly demanded money from disability and pension recipients to process any back payments.In February, 15 people were arrested for fraud involving Sassa throughout the province.They included six money lenders who were found in possession of 320 Sassa cards.

BRENTWOOD — A Hampton couple accused of voting twice in the 2016 general election both pleaded guilty Monday in Rockingham County Superior Court to felony-level violations for casting ballots in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.John S. Fleming Jr., 71, and Grace Fleming, 70, each pleaded guilty to one charge of voting in more than one state prohibited, for casting an absentee ballot in Hampton for the Nov. 8, 2016, election and another ballot in Belchertown, Mass., during the same election.According to the Belchertown clerk’s office, both Flemings voted in person in 2016. They registered to vote through the Registry of Motor Vehicles on Aug. 18, 2016. Both registered Republican.Both John and Grace Fleming were sentenced to 60 days in prison, each sentence suspended for one year for good behavior. The court also ordered the Flemings to each pay a $1,000 fine, with a penalty assessment of $240.The couple has also lost their rights to vote in New Hampshire, Attorney General Gordon MacDonald said in a statement.New Hampshire is part of the Interstate Voter Crosscheck Program — a multi-state database used to compare voter information to identify voters who are registered in more than one state.The Secretary of State’s office is responsible for investigating any matches found during the crosscheck to see if a voter cast more than one ballot in the same election. The results of the investigations are sent to the Attorney General’s office for possible prosecution.The Flemings were the first to be indicted since New Hampshire entered the Interstate Voter Crosscheck Program, signed into law in 2016.A third voter, Spencer McKinnon, 20, was also indicted on a similar charge by a Strafford County grand jury in September.According to authorities, McKinnon allegedly checked in at the checklist and cast a ballot in Durham during the 2016 general election, but also submitted an absentee ballot for the same election in Dracut, Mass.In May, the Secretary of State’s office referred 51 cases to the attorney general for further investigation. Many of those investigations remain ongoing.

TARPON SPRINGS – The owner of a car dealership has been accused of fraud in connection with the sale of a 1965 Ford Cobra Mustang that was on consignment, the Tarpon Springs Police Department said.
Wassim “Peter” Rouh Nasr, 50, of Tarpon Springs, was charged with one count of fraud involving a security interest. He is the owner of Exotic Motorcars, 41041 U.S. 19 N in Tarpon Springs. Officers said they are also investigating the dealership in connection with allegations concerning the issuance of multiple worthless checks and possible title fraud. The police department has been helped in its investigation by the Bureau of Dealers Services.
Police said the owner of the 1965 Ford Cobra Mustang put the car on consignment at the dealership on May 8. The dealership agreed to sell the vehicle for $57,000.
On May 19, the dealership sold the car to an overseas buyer for $57,000, police said, but the dealership concealed the sale of the vehicle from the owner and continued to actively communicate with the owner throughout May and into June implying that the car hadn’t yet been sold.
The owner discovered his Mustang was in the process of being sold when he arrived at the dealership at the end of June and saw it was no longer on the property. The owner was convinced by Wassim that he needed to accept the prospective purchaser’s offer of $52,000 dollars because no other higher offers had been made.
The dealership wrote the car’s owner a check for $52,000 on July 6. The check bounced because of insufficient funds, officers said. The dealership provided the owner with another check that cleared.
The owner call Tarpon Springs police about the bounced check and officers began investigating.
Police said they discovered the dealership had deceived the owner into believing his vehicle had only sold for $52,000. In addition to the uncovering of this deception, police said, the investigation revealed a power of attorney and certificate of title had been forged by the dealership in the owner’s name to help sell the car.
Police said they are investigating four other complaints from parties who were issued bounced checks by Exotic Motorcars. The bounced checks that have so far been reported to the police department total more than $185,000.
Anyone who would like to report any similar crimes or have information that could help in the investigation against Exotic Motorcars is asked to contact Detective Lemmon at (727) 938-2849.

 The case pertains to alleged duping of thousands of investors, mostly from rural areas across Maharashtra, allegedly by now-defunct KBC Multi-trade Pvt Ltd over the last four years.

 Two prime suspects, namely Bhausaheb Chavan, the founder of the company, and his wife Arati are absconding and believed to be in Singapore. Local police had already written to the state CID to initiate steps in this regard.

 Six of the eight accused arrested so far and whose remand was extended today are: Bapusaheb Chavan, his wife Sadhana, Manager of the firm Pankaj Shinde, driver Nitin Shinde, one Nana Chavan and a policeman Sanjay Jagtap, said police inspector Anil Pawar.

 Two other accused, namely Bharati Shiledar, who is the sister-in-law of the prime suspect, and one Kaushalya Jagtap, arrested from neighbouring Ahmed Nagar district, are likely to be produced before the court on July 23, Pawar said.

 City police have so far received more than 3,000 complaints from investors claiming that they were lured with foreign trips and attractive returns by Chavan before being duped.

 Chavan used to operate from a posh office located in Adgaon area.

 Earlier this month, a staff nurse working with civil hospital here, who had invested money with the KBC, committed suicide on July 15 along with her 22-year-old son who was working as an agent for the company.

 Meanwhile, a roadside vendor, who had reportedly invested Rs 5 lakh in the firm, attempted suicide at his residence yesterday over loss of money. Yashwant Badgujar tried to take his own life by consuming poisonous substance and was rushed to a hospital.

 According to police, he had taken loan from a bank to invest in KBC but has become frustrated as the lender prodded him to pay the instalments.

		Three Arrested in Voter Signature Fraud on Skid Row	


					By Eric Leonard and Andrew Blankstein							•

Published May 23, 2018 •
Updated on May 23, 2018 at 6:52 pm 





























How much does it cost buy a fraudulent voter signature in LA?
Not a lot, according to the LAPD -- just a dollar and a smoke.
Three men were arrested on Skid Row in Downtown Los Angeles Saturday — while allegedly paying homeless people with cash and cigarettes — to falsify names and signatures on official campaign petitions, police said.

The men had been observed engaging in suspicious interactions with people on sidewalks Sixth and San Julian streets last week, but it was only after consultation with state elections officials that the arrests were made during an undercover operation days later, carried out by police assigned to the Central Division.
""This is voter fraud, which we talk about, and we know it exists, but it isn't exactly something that patrol officers deal with,"" said LAPD Detective Meghan Aguilar, a department spokeswoman.
She said the men were asking people on the street to sign several different political forms.
""They were petitions, and so they'd have them sign that petition as a fictitious person and they'd receive minimal compensation for that signature,"" Aguilar said.
Thousands of dollars in cash and lists of LA County registered voters were booked into evidence, police said. Other law enforcement officials said the men were carrying signature-gathering paperwork to qualify at least four measures for upcoming elections.
Those included an LA County effort to reduce jail time and expand oversight of the Sheriff's Department. They also had statewide measures to reduce the number of felons considered non-violent, increase income tax on millionaires and property tax on business owners, and a local effort in Long Beach to improve safety for some hotel workers. 
None of the authors or supporters of those measures were suspected of involvement in the signature fraud. The case was presented to the LA County District Attorney's Office public integrity division on Tuesday but no charges were filed.
Prosecutors have asked police to do more investigative work and the three men have been released from jail. The LA County Registrar-Recorder's Office said it had not been notified by law enforcement about the arrests or the initiatives involved, but said in a statement Wednesday there would be ample opportunity for elections officials to detect any forgeries.
""When our office receives a petition it is our responsibility to ensure the signatures provided are valid. To ensure validity, every signature that is submitted for local and county petitions are cross-referenced with the registered voter’s signature on the voter file,"" the statement said. ""If a signature does not match what is on the voter file we will flag the signature and it will not be counted."" 
Paid signature gathering companies, that can charge $2 or more per signature depending on the political campaign, said they often contract with multiple companies, that in turn hire or contract with temporary workers to circulate the petitions.
They said a small percentage of signatures submitted later turn out to be false or forged but it was nearly impossible to identify those responsible. In addition to the men who allegedly offered money for forged signatures another man and woman were arrested on suspicion of signing petitions using false names, booking records showed.

She has to repay $20,922.73.Special to the Daily |EAGLE — An Eagle woman has admitted to almost $21,000 of welfare fraud.Nancy Chairez-Hernandez, 33, from Eagle, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years probation, and has to repay $20,922.73 that she bilked out of Eagle County Heath and Human Services, and pay $2,858.50 in court costs and fees.She is now disqualified from ever receiving any government assistance as a result of her felony conviction.  “Over the past several months, we have been able to obtain court orders that offenders pay back approximately $200,000 that have been stolen from the government by fraudulently obtaining governmental benefits,” said District Attorney Bruce Brown.Between May 2012 and January 2017, Chairez-Hernandez fraudulently applied for Medicaid for herself and household members. She failed to disclose her husband’s income during these years while receiving thousands of dollars in public assistance benefits for herself and her children.  Had truthful disclosure occurred, she would not have been eligible for the governmental assistance received, Brown said.In March 2016, an anonymous tip showed up at Eagle County Health and Human Services received an anonymous tip sent to the county’s welfare fraud website, that Chairez-Hernandez was receiving public assistance benefits, but was also living with her husband whose income was not included in her application to Eagle County Health and Human Services. That kicked off the investigation by Eagle County Sheriff’s detectives.“Defrauding programs that support families in need or those designed to fight hunger serving low-income Americans is reprehensible,” Brown said.  In one of the most spectacular cases of welfare fraud, Karen Iuele admitted she committed welfare fraud in Eagle County while she was in custody in Garfield County for forgery and theft.In fact, on the day Iuele pleaded guilty in a Pitkin County case, she renewed her application for food stamps and Medicaid through Eagle County’s human services department.When Iuele was incarcerated in Rifle and applying for food stamps and Medicaid, she used her address in the Eagle County corner of the Roaring Fork Valley.Like Chairez-Hernandez, Iuele was caught when someone sent a tip that Iuele had income that she had not reported.According to court documents, Iuele claimed:• She was not married. She was actually married, and court documents show that her husband’s income alone would have disqualified them from welfare benefits.• Her daughter was living with her. She was not.• She failed to list that she was a felony probation violator.  Support Local JournalismDonateStart a dialogue, stay on topic and be civil.

They allegedly assisted foreign 'students' in fraudulently obtaining immigration documents from the varsity and facilitated the creation of false student records.



Tens of people, the overwhelming majority of whom are highly likely to be Indian citizens or of Indian origin, have been arrested across cities in the U.S. in connection with student visa fraud charges, according to court documents, news reports, first hand witness accounts, legal and diplomatic sources accessible to The Hindu. Emerging patterns suggest most of the individuals are of Telugu origin.Eight of these individuals were arrested on counts of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and to harbour aliens (non-U.S. citizens) for profit, according to the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, a statement from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District, Matthew Schneider, said. Of these eight arrests, six were made in Detroit, one in Florida and one in Virginia.In addition to the eight “educational agents” allegedly running the racket, an unspecified number of Indian students have been detained by the Department of Homeland Security in connection with the above case. The American Telugu Association has put the number of students arrested at 100 and says it has confirmation of arrest warrants for 600 students based on conversations with attorneys. The Hindu has not been able to verify the number of people arrested. It has reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is awaiting a response to confirm the numbers.

129 of 130 arrested in U.S. visa fraud scheme are Indians




 At least 25 of those enrolled at Farmington have been confirmed as arrested, Rahul Reddy, a Houston-based lawyer at an immigration law firm, Reddy & Neumann, told The Hindu. Mr. Reddy had spoken to some of those detained or to their roommates or close relatives.The indictments unsealed on Wednesday said the eight individuals at the centre of the racket were “a group of foreign citizens”. It is highly likely that all eight are Indian citizens based on their names, their characterisation in the charge-sheet and discussions with sources.The fraud is based on a sting operation involving Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents who had posed as owners and employees of the University of Farmington in Farmington Hills, Michigan, approximately between June 2017 and January 2019.Students would pay to enrol in the University, giving the appearance that they were in approved educational programs and making normal progress towards getting a degree. However, the University had no faculty nor any classes, the indictment says, and the students were aware of this. The “pay to stay” scheme allowed them to maintain their student visa (F-1) status and obtain work permits as part of the Curricular Practical Training (CPT) option open to qualified F-1 visa students.

 One of the eight defendants, an Aswanth ( aka Ashwanth) Nune,  is alleged to have made in excess of $25,000 via this scheme , and assisted at least 18 other foreign citizens, as per the charge-sheet reviewed by The Hindu. Mr. Nune, the charges go, enlisted foreign citizens at the university in return for cash, kickbacks,  “scholarships” and course credit. Mr. Nune also allegedly helped foreign citizens maintain their student visa status and obtain employment authorisation in the U.S. The other seven individuals arrested are Barath Kakireddy, 29, of Lake Mary, FL, Suresh Kandala, 31, of Culpeper, Virginina, Phanideep Karnati, 35, of Louisville, Kentucky, Prem Rampeesa, 26, of Charlotte, North Carolina, Santosh Sama, 28, of Fremont, California, Avinash Thakkallapally, 28, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Aswanth Nune, 26, of Atlanta, Georgia and Naveen Prathipati, 26, of Dallas, Texas. If convicted, they could be jailed for up to five years.“We are all aware that international students can be a valuable asset to our country, but as this case shows, the well-intended international student visa programme can also be exploited and abused, “Mr. Schneider said in a statement.About 600 facilitated for illegal stayThe defendants helped at least 600 foreign citizens as per one of the indictments, The Detroit Free Press reported. This means the number of “students” who will eventually be detained could run into the hundreds, and it is likely the majority of them are Indian citizens. At least 36 arrests of individuals posing as students were confirmed, diplomatic source told The Hindu.The Indian Embassy in Washington and Indian Consulates across the country have been in touch with Indian community and Indian student associations in the U.S. as well as U.S. authorities to provide those detained with consular assistance, the Indian Embassy told The Hindu.One of the “students” arrested, Babu (full name withheld on request) was taken away at dawn by DHS agents who knocked on his door at about 6.00 AM on Wednesday,  Karthik (full name withheld upon request) , an engineer who shares a flat with Babu and a third female house-mate told The Hindu. The Hindu was able to verify Karthik’s identity based on work information he provided. The agents asked Babu where he was studying, what he was studying and whether he was taking online classes. Babu answered the last question in the affirmative but could not name any professors.Babu spoke with Karthik in the afternoon on Wednesday and asked Karthik to contact a non-profit that could help him get an attorney. The number of the non-profit was provided to Babu by the authorities.   Babu , who sounded scared and “pretty low” according to Karthik, could not identify where he had been detained. Karthik has also been in touch with the Indian Embassy in Washington, he said to The Hindu.The University of Farmington has a website with details of its history, admissions and fees – which appear noticeably  low.  Graduate tuition per quarter is an estimated $2,500 or $10,000 per year compared to some $36,000 per year tuition at Michigan State for those who cannot claim state resident fees.The defendants intended to help shield and hide their customers/ students from United States immigration authorities for money and collectively profited in excess of a quarter of a million dollars as a result of their scheme, the ICE said.“We are all aware that international students can be a valuable asset to our country, but as this case shows, the well-intended international student visa programme can also be exploited and abused, stated US Attorney Matthew Schneider.According to the indictment, the university was being used by foreign citizens as a ‘pay to stay’ scheme which allowed these individuals to stay in the United States as full-time students in an “approved” educational programme.Each of the foreign citizen who enrolled and made tuition payments to the university knew that they would not attend accrual classes, earn credits or make progress towards an actual degree in a particular field of study — a pay to stay scheme, the indictment said.“Rather their intent was to fraudulently maintain their student visa status and to obtain work authorisation under the CPT programme, the indictment said, claiming that each student knew that the university programme was not approved by the Department of Homeland Security, was illegal and that discretion should be used when discussing the programme with others.It is the second such case when Department of Homeland Security has used a fake university to unearth a fake student visa racket.In 2016, ICE had arrested some 21 people for similar charges for a fake University of Northern New Jersey.(With inputs from Suhasini Haidar)Our Hyderabad correspondent R. Ravikanth Reddy adds:ATA reaches out to students for counsellingThe American Telugu Association (ATA) president, Parmesh Bheemreddy told The Hindu that affected students called up the ATA for guidance and help and the local ATA teams have reached out to Indian students Associations of various universities for counselling. The legal teams of ATA are also speaking to the affected students for legal help and counselling as they have been issued arrest warrants.The ATA also met the Indian Ambassador Harshvardhan Shingla and the Indian Consulate General Swati Vijay Kulkarni in Atlanta to brief them and sought assistance for remediation efforts, Mr. Bheemreddy said.According to Mr. Bheemreddy, this is not the first such incident and several foreign students including Indian students were arrested and deported in similar operations in Tri Valley University and Herguan University in California in 2011 and 2012. Some of them were given an option to change the University for continuing their education at that time. However, in this episode students may not get that opportunity as they willingly joined the fake university just to maintain their student status.Mr. Bheemreddy said the ATA is conducting an Immigration seminar on January 31 with Immigration attorneys Ravi Mannam, Michael Sofo and Hemant Ramachandran and they will guide students how to avoid fake recruiters who promise illegal ways to stay in the USA through admissions in unaccredited colleges and universities. The attorneys will also discuss what constitutes violation of immigration laws and the right approach to be a legal immigrant.

California politician's gay lover accused of $600million funeral home fraudTyler Cassity accompanied California Assembly Speaker John Perez on a trip to Israel where he met the country's president and other officialsMr Cassity also met British royalty at a dinner in CaliforniaThe Cassity family is accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in one of the largest-ever fraud schemes By Ryan Gorman   Published:  16:08 GMT, 14 October 2013   |  Updated:  12:48 GMT, 15 October 2013     


         e-mail          5 View  comments    The judgement of an influential Democratic California politician is being called into question after it has been revealed he took a boyfriend under a fraud investigation on trips to meet foreign dignitaries and even accepted a donation from him.John Perez, 44, speaker of the California Assembly, dated Hollywood funeral director Tyler Cassity between 2011 and 2012. During that time he was aware of a $600million fraud investigation into Mr Cassity’s family’s companies, according to the San Diego Union Tribune.Mr Cassity accompanied his high-profile boyfriend on trips to meet British royalty, the Israeli president and other officials. The speaker also accepted a $1,000 donation from Mr Cassity, despite knowing it might have come from ill-gotten funds.      Questionable ethics: John Perez, Speaker of the California State Assembly, was in a relationship with a man accused of taking part in a massive fraud scheme  The politician even convinced state bigwigs to donate to Cassity-favored AIDS/LifeCycle, the paper noted. All this, despite a lawsuit filed in 2009 claiming the Cassity family pillaged trust funds and insurance policies of hundreds of millions of dollars.The scam may be the largest in U.S. funeral industry history, an industry analyst told the paper.Filed in St Louis, Missouri, the suit accuses National Prearranged Services Inc collapsed as a result of the family’s pilfering, as detailed by the paper.In 2010, both Mr Cassity’s father and brother pleaded guilty to felony charges related to the scam, but he was not charged despite the lawsuit insisting he was guilty of racketeering and fraud.Hollywood Forever and Fernwood cemetery, both run by Mr Cassity, 43, are accused in the lawsuit of being run with stolen money.       Accused fraudster: Tyler Cassity is accused of being part of a $600million fraud scheme  Despite becoming aware of the lawsuit and fraud investigation after beginning their relationship, Mr Lopez did not ask for details, a spokesperson told the paper, adding that the Speaker decided to let it play out in courts.The suit also alleges over $1million was embezzled to pay off Mr Cassity’s personal credit card bills.Mr Cassity has fought the lawsuit, but has not responded to any interview requests from the paper. His lawyer also declined to comment.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Banker is sued for 'running up $320,000 tab at strip club on...

 In light of these revelations, Kirk Hanson, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, told the Union Times that Mr Pérez displayed ‘colossal bad judgment’ for continuing the relationship.The ethics expert cited the $1,000 political donation accepted from Mr Cassity by Mr Lopez, and the alleged fraudster’s inclusion among dignitaries, as further proof of his questionable judgement displayed by the politician.      Hollywood Forever: The extravagant Holly cemetery owned by Tyler Cassity is at the center of a massive fraud scandal                  Legendary: 'Gone with the Wind's Hattie McDaniel and Looney Tunes voice legend Mel Blanc are among the Hollywood icons buried at Hollywood Forever  The duo were seen at events including Prince William and wife Kate Middleton and a trip to Israel where they met Israeli President Shimon Peres and other officials, according to the Union Tribune.Mr Lopez isn’t the only politician to have received donations from the accused thief. Through a SuperPAC he set up, Mr Cassity has donated about $38,000 to Democratic candidates and causes, records cited by the paper show.Additionally, of the $53,000 in donations raised by Mr Cassity, for AIDS/LifeCycle, more than $33,000 came from lawmakers, lobbyists and Sacramento political contributors with ties to the speaker,’ the paper reported.Donors included ‘lobbyists, including two former Assembly speakers, Fabian Núñez and Robert Hertzberg,’ according to the paper. Another ‘seven have worked for either Pérez’s legislative office or his political operation,’ the paper further revealed.Mr Lopez has declined comment to the Union Tribune, and could not be reached by MailOnline.Through a spokesperson, he told the Union TImes he has not seen Mr Cassity for about 18 months.

A Linwood man has became the 15th person to plead guilty in federal court in Camden to his role in a $50 million fraud scheme targeting the state health-benefits system.Nicholas Tedesco, 44, is a retail director for a local candy company.Tedesco admitted defrauding state benefits programs and other insurers out of more than $2 million by submitting fraudulent claims for medically unnecessary prescriptions, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito and New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said.Tedesco pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler to an information charging him with conspiracy to commit health care fraud.                                       
Tedesco’s brother and a leader in the conspiracy, Matthew Tedesco, pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme Aug. 17.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
From January 2015 through April 2016, Nicholas Tedesco and others recruited individuals in New Jersey to obtain very expensive and medically unnecessary compounded medications from an out-of-state pharmacy, identified in the information as the “compounding pharmacy.”The conspirators knew that certain compound medication prescriptions — including pain, scar, anti-fungal, and libido creams, as well as vitamin combinations — were reimbursed for thousands of dollars for a one-month supply, according to court documents.


The conspirators also knew that some New Jersey state and local government and education employees, including teachers, firefighters, municipal police officers and state troopers, had insurance coverage for these particular medications.An entity referred to in the information as the “pharmacy benefits administrator” provided pharmacy benefit management services for the State Health Benefits Program, which covers qualified state and local government employees, retirees, and eligible dependents, and the School Employees’ Health Benefits Program, which covers qualified local education employees, retirees, and eligible dependents.
The pharmacy benefits administrator would pay prescription drug claims and then bill the State of New Jersey for the amounts paid.
Nicholas Tedesco and others recruited public employees and other individuals covered by the pharmacy benefits administrator to fraudulently obtain compounded medications that were not medically necessary. The prescriptions were faxed to the compounding pharmacy, which filled the prescriptions and billed the pharmacy benefits administrator.The pharmacy then paid one of Nicholas Tedesco’s conspirators a percentage of each prescription filled and paid by the pharmacy benefits administrator, which was then distributed to Nicholas Tedesco and other members of the conspiracy. Nicholas Tedesco paid individuals with insurance coverage in cash to reward them for obtaining prescriptions.

According to the information, the pharmacy benefits administrator paid compounding pharmacy over $50 million for compounded medications mailed to individuals in New Jersey.
As part of the plea agreement, Nicholas Tedesco must forfeit $782,766.56 in criminal proceeds and pay restitution of at least $2,069,847.42. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. Sentencing is scheduled for June 1.
Fourteen other conspirators – including Matthew Tedesco, Robert Bessey, Michael Pepper, Thomas Hodnett, Steven Urbanski, John Gaffney, Judd Holt, George Gavras, Richard Zappala, Michael Neopolitan, Andrew Gerstel, Timothy Frazier, Michael Pilate, and Shawn Sypherd – pleaded guilty from last August through this month and await sentencing.Carpenito credited agents of the FBI’s Atlantic City Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Timothy Gallagher in Newark, IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan D. Larsen in Newark, and the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Peter Nozka in New York, with the investigation leading to the guilty plea.
Carpenito also thanked the pensions and financial transactions section of the Division of Law, within the Attorney General’s Office, under the direction of Attorney General Grewal and Division Chief Eileen Schlindwein Den Bleyker, for its assistance in the investigation.


The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacqueline M. Carle and R. David Walk, Jr. of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Camden. The defense counsel is David Jay Glassman Esq., Philadelphia.Contact: 609-272-7202VJackson@pressofac.comTwitter@ACPressJackson

Huntley contractor pleads guilty to fraud, failing to pay taxes | Northwest Herald

LocalHuntley contractor pleads guilty to fraud, failing to pay taxesBy ED KOMENDAEmailFollowOct. 17, 2017Shaw Media file photoCaptionShaw Media file photo
HUNTLEY – A Huntley concrete contractor pleaded guilty to defrauding labor union benefit plans and failing to pay more than $600,000 in taxes, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
In March 2015, a 27-count federal indictment claimed that Thomas Manning, 60, president of T. Manning Concrete Inc., underpaid required monthly contributions for the company’s labor union employees and falsified the number of hours the employees worked.

Manning was unavailable for comment Monday. Phone numbers listed for his company have been disconnected. The company’s website is no longer active. The state of Illinois dissolved T. Manning Concrete Inc. as a business in 2012, according to online records.
The indictment alleged that Manning failed to collect and pay nearly $600,680 in taxes for the employees’ share of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.
Manning pleaded guilty to the charges in a written plea agreement filed this week, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Hiring cement masons and workers from labor unions in northern Illinois, Manning was required by collective bargaining agreements to report monthly to benefit plans the number of hours each union employee worked and disclose the company’s contributions to the plans.
Beginning in 2006, Manning started to defraud the benefit plans, underreporting the number of hours employees worked in the monthly reports and underpaying the required monthly contributions for the company’s covered employees, according to the U.S. State’s Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois.
In an effort to conceal the understatements, Manning paid the covered employees for additional hours “under the table,” using checks drawn from nonpayroll accounts controlled by Manning. Manning sent the reports and contribution checks to the benefit plans via U.S. mail.

Because of the falsified reports, Manning caused the benefit plans to make false statements in annual reports required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the federal indictment alleges. Because he paid covered employees under the table, Manning also failed to collect, account and pay $600,680 in federal taxes for the employees’ share of FICA between 2007 and 2010, the indictment said.
Manning also submitted falsified forms to the Internal Revenue Service because of the underreported wages and withheld taxes, the indictment said.
Under the 27-count indictment, Manning was charged with five counts of mail fraud, five counts of causing false statements to be made on forms required by ERISA, 16 counts of failing to collect and pay FICA taxes, and one count of obstructing the IRS.

Manning is scheduled for sentencing Jan. 24. 
Manning faces a $250,000 fine, up to five years in prison and three years of supervised release for each count, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Welton Kalani, 48, was found guilty on 12 counts of conspiracy, mail and wire fraud, obstruction of justice and money laundering.     Kalani's accomplice, 51-year-old Stephen Balino, was found guilty of seven counts of conspiracy, mail and wire fraud, making false statements on loan applications, and money laundering.     According to information produced in court, Kalani and Balino owned mortgage brokerage companies offering loans to the public. Kalani was the co-owner of Accel Mortgage, LLC and Balino was the owner of New Horizons Financial in Downtown Honolulu.             Court evidence showed that Kalani, Balino and others offered homeowners in financial troubles an opportunity to stay in their homes rent free by transferring title to others temporarily.     Kalani and Balino promised the homeowners that a ""buyer"" would purchase the property and make the mortgage payments until the homeowners were able to buy back the property.     The two men then recruited others to serve as ""straw buyers"" by promising them money to induce them to create false loan applications to fund the false purchases.             Trial evidence focused on three transactions involving the sale of two properties in Aiea and Mililani.             According to the USDOJ, the brokers were paid fees and commissions for procuring the loans following each sale. The equity in the property was also diverted away from the seller and channeled through third parties to Kalani, Balino and individuals working for them.     Evidence showed that in the three sales, the conspirators diverted $98,000, $78,000 and $51,000.     The USDOJ says eight other individuals pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the same transactions and testified during the trial. Five of those individuals worked with Kalani at Accel Mortgage, which is no longer in business.     Sentencing is set for April 26, 2012 before United State District Judge Leslie Kobayashi.

A group of men allegedly accessed a shopping portal’s customer list illegally, posed as Flipkart officials and lured a few customers to transfer money into several accounts as participation fee for a fictitious lucky draw contest with false promises of assured gifts.Three people have been arrested in connection with the case and charged with forgery, cheating, fraud and impersonation.Senior officials of the Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd lodged a complaint with Hare Street police station in March after which the case was handed over to the anti-fraud section of the detective department.“The accused persons had made calls or sent phishing mails to the customers inviting them to participate in a lucky draw scheme that had assured return gifts. Several people had fallen into the trap and transferred money into the accounts as mentioned by the imposters. But later, the fraud was realised when the customers neither got any gifts nor was the money refunded,” said a senior officer of the detective department.Police investigation had revealed that the fraud had started in December 2018 and was detected a few months later. Investigators suspect that someone with access to customer data had leaked it to the fraudsters.Although initially it was found that the documents with which the bank accounts had been opened were false, cops managed to zero in on the accused through their phone numbers. Investigators have started tracking the details of the bank accounts where the money was transferred.Based on specific information, two youths men — Gulraj Ahmed, 23, and Vishal Sharma, 25 — were arrested from in front of the GPO on NS Road on Friday afternoon. Pursuing their statement, a third accused, Mohammad Sadik, 20, was arrested from near Chingrighata crossing along the EM Bypass later on Friday. Officers examining the trio found that the team used to operate from a house in Prafulla Kanan area in Baguiati.“False identity documents used for opening bank accounts, customer database of the Flipkart, CPU and hard disks were seized from the Bahuiati address,” said a cop.A local court has remanded all the three accused in police custody on Saturday. Lakhs of people who opt for online transactions are at the risk of their data being stolen or misused by people who handle them.Asked, Flipkart declined to comment. However, a source close to the e-retailer denied any leak of sensitive information from the customer database. “It is an offline breach,” said the source.The source said: “It is possible that these people followed the delivery boys and acquired knowledge about the customers buying pattern, which aided them to trick unsuspecting buyers with offers of goodies.”“All reputable portals have their security features that protect the privacy of their customers. But it becomes difficult to protect data is someone from inside breaches the system. In this case, it is yet to be ascertained, how the data got leaked,” an officer who is part of the probing team, said.The police have seized several documents containing a list of Flipkart customers. A police officer said shopping portals had their own customer safety manuals and usually do not call their customers.“It is advisable that people should not make online payments to any unknown accounts unless it is through the official website or the app of the portal,” the officer added.

Margo Malone 
BATON ROUGE, LA – Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry today announced two more arrests made by his national award-winning Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. 
“In order to bring welfare fraudsters to justice, our MFCU often relies on the public’s help in exposing the crimes,” Landry said. “So we once again encourage anyone who may know of people using the Medicaid program to illegally take money, services, or drugs to report it to our office.” 
Margo Malone, 44 of Bossier City, was arrested on five counts of Medicaid Fraud for allegedly claiming to provide $19,089.58 of services to clients to whom she did not render services. 
Cecilia Cheatteam, 36 of Harvey, was arrested on four counts of Medicaid Fraud for allegedly submitting timesheets and service logs for overlapping services on two clients – amounting to $10,425.06 paid by the Medicaid program for services not rendered.    
Following investigations by General Landry’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, both women were arrested and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. 
To report Medicaid welfare fraud and/or neglect in residential care facilities, call Landry’s Medicaid Fraud Hotline at 888-799-6885 or visit www.AGJeffLandry.com.

TOWER HILL — Nancy Finley, the former Tower Hill treasurer accused of siphoning off and stealing more than $150,000 from village water and sewer bills, is now pleading guilty to three federal charges of wire fraud.But the federal case isn’t the end of her legal problems: She still faces a pending Shelby County Circuit Court theft charge alleging she stole more than $100,000 from the village. But one of her attorneys said Wednesday that he hoped the county charges might be dropped once the federal case is concluded.
Finley, 54, appeared in the United States District Court in Springfield on Friday with her attorney, Daniel Fultz, and entered the guilty pleas. Magistrate Judge Tom Schanzle-Haskins accepted the pleas and ordered a pre-investigation report before scheduling a sentencing hearing for June 8. Finley, who lives near Pana, remains free on a $10,000 recognizance bond in the federal case and $50,000 cash bail in the county case.
Court records show that she has yet to enter a plea in that case and a preliminary hearing, which has been rescheduled 12 times since her arrest on Nov. 8, 2017, is now set for May 20.

The federal charges were detailed in a grand jury indictment which said she raided the village’s water and sewer accounts by draining off the payments families and businesses made on their bills between 2009 and 2017. Finley, who was hired as treasurer in 1998, is accused of covering up what she was doing by subverting a computerized billing system to hide her thievery.
Finley is further accused of helping herself to cash from other village accounts and using wire transfers to funnel the stolen monies into her personal bank account.

The indictment says her technique for covering up what she was doing also included altering copies of checks to hide where the money was going and falsifying computerized accounting files. At one point, the indictment said, she even “falsely represented that the village computer on which she worked had crashed, resulting in a loss of water and sewer billing data.”
Finley’s attorney in the federal case, Daniel Fultz, said Wednesday that a sentencing deal has been negotiated with prosecutors but it has yet to be approved by the judge and he couldn’t comment on the details. Asked if he was pushing for Finley not to get prison time, Fultz said he could not speak to that.
“I don’t think it’s in anyone’s interests at this point to discuss what the terms are,” he added.The attorney did say, while stressing he is not the attorney representing Finley in the county theft case, that a satisfactory conclusion of the federal charges would smooth the way for the county charges getting dropped. “We do anticipate this will dispose of the state case as well, which is based on the same issue,” added Fultz, who works for the law firm Brown, Hay & Stephens.

Attorney Dustin Probst, who is defending Finley in the county case, declined comment when reached at his office Wednesday.

Two Woodland Hills Men Who Operated More Than $100 Million Ponzi Scheme Involving ATMs Plead Guilty to Federal Fraud Charges




LOS ANGELES—The president of a Calabasas firm that was used to run a Ponzi scheme that caused investors to loss more than $100 million pleaded guilty this morning to federal fraud charges.
Joel Barry Gillis, 74, of Woodland Hills, pleaded guilty in relation to a 13-year-long scheme that collected hundreds of millions from investors who were told their money would be used to purchase profitable automated teller machines.
The second man charged in the scheme related to Nationwide Automated Systems, Inc. (NASI)—Edward Wishner, 76, also of Woodland Hills, who held various titles at NASI, including vice president—pleaded guilty on January 13 in the case that bilked approximately 2,000 investors.
Gillis and Wishner each pleaded guilty to conspiracy, two counts of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud. As a result of their guilty pleas, each defendant faces a statutory maximum sentence of 80 years in federal prison.
Both men are scheduled to be sentenced on March 30 by United States District Judge S. James Otero.
According to documents filed in United States District Court, Gillis and Wishner operated NASI, which purported to place, operate and maintain ATMs in high-traffic locations, such as hotels, casinos and convenience stores. NASI claimed that it operated approximately 31,000 ATMs and was involved in more than $1 billion in ATM transactions every month.
Victim-investors paid a flat amount—typically $12,000, but in some cases as much as $19,800– to buy a specific ATM, each of which was to be installed at a specific location. Gillis and Wishner told victim-investors that NASI would lease back the ATMs and pay investors 50 cents for each transaction performed at their particular ATM, guaranteeing annual returns of 20 percent on each ATM.
NASI did make monthly payments to investors, but that money came from other investors. While NASI did operate a small number of ATMs—no more than 250, which were owned by the company and not investors—the overall operation was a sham. Gillis and Wishner prevented investors from discovering the fraudulent nature of the business by providing bogus monthly reports to the investors that falsely detailed the supposed performance of the investors’ ATMs. Gillis and Wishner also included a “non-interference” provision in the lease agreements that prohibited victim-investors from visiting the locations where their ATMs were supposedly located.
The scheme unraveled this past summer. In August, “NASI bounced approximately $3 million in checks that had been sent by NASI as monthly returns to victim-investors,” according to the charging document in the case. “By the end of the month, NASI had drained its bank account, drawing it down to a balance of less than $200,000.”
But, even as the Ponzi was collapsing, Gillis and Wishner continued to raise another $4 million from victim-investors.
This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provided substantial assistance in the matter.
The SEC filed a civil lawsuit in relation to the NASI scheme in September, which resulted in a court order freezing the company’s assets and having a receiver appointed to oversee the assets (see: http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23106.htm).

Tom Murrell accused of benefiting from Gearhart fraud
July 9, 2013  


Kelly Gearhart

By KAREN VELIE
San Luis Obispo County Superior Court Judge Charles Crandall Monday denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit against Cuesta Title, Stewart Title and Heritage Oaks Bank noting the defendants were aware of wrongdoings.
In 2009, more than 300 investors filed a lawsuit alleging Stewart Title, Cuesta Title and Heritage Oaks Bank aided and abetted and/or conspired with Hurst Financial Inc. and former North County developer Kelly Gearhart in defrauding hundreds of seniors through illegal investment schemes.
In their lawsuit, San Diego based attorneys Steven Sanchez and David Noonan cite examples of the title company creating false escrows, falsely closing active escrows, and illegally filing clean title reports before placing additional loans on already encumbered properties.
According to Monday’s ruling, Gearhart’s former partner Tom Murrell personally benefited from his position as the president of Cuesta Title. In one example, even though the title on a Morro Road property had multiple beneficiaries, the investors were lumped together on one title because the property had not yet been subdivided.
“As a consequence, Murrell and Gearhart’s company was paid approximately $1.5 million in plaintiff’s investor money to purchase property, thereby directly benefitting Murrell in a transaction closed by his own escrow company,” the ruling says.
The plaintiffs also accuse Heritage Oaks Bank officials of being aware of the Gearhart/Hurst scheme when they approved a $1.5 million loan which permitted the bank to obtain a priority secured interest in the Vista Del Hombre project, effectively wiping out the investors’ encumbrances.
In its request for a motion to dismiss the suit against the bank, attorneys for Heritage Oaks Bank claim that Cuesta Title employees failed to inform the bank’s loan officer, Greg Porter, of the pre-existing liens.
However, in a deposition, former Cuesta Title employee Marcus Harmon testified he showed Porter the investor liens in a title report.
Yesterday, Judge Crandall denied both the title company’s and the bank’s motions to dismiss concluding, “A serious fraud has plainly been perpetrated on a wide group of investors, which is reflected in the indictments and/or convictions of several key players.”
Gearhart and the former president of Hurst Financial, James Miller, have been accused of helping to defraud more than 1,200 investors of more than $100 million in an alleged Ponzi scheme.
In the summer of 2011, Miller agreed to plead guilty to charges of fraud and money laundering as part of a plea agreement the court then filed under seal.
In August 2012, Gearhart pleaded not guilty to 16 charges of mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering at a federal court in Los Angeles. He faces up to 300 years in federal prison if convicted on all charges. His trial is set for Nov. 12.

This is pretty much what happened in SLO County, particularly the North County …. and with full cooperation with the politicians and muckity mucks.

Outcome Health


A rendering of a TV in a doctor's waiting room with Outcome Health's content.










The first person charged in the ongoing fraud investigation into Outcome Health pleaded guilty today in federal court.Ashik Desai, who was in charge of business development at the healthcare advertising company, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud this morning before U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin. Desai faces up to 10 years in prison as part of the plea agreement, prosecutors said.Desai, 26, admitted to being at the center of a fraud scheme in which Outcome overcharged pharmaceutical companies for advertising in doctors' offices they didn't receive by falsifying internal reports and data sent to clients.Desai is one of a half-dozen former employees of Outcome who have been charged in connection with what federal prosecutors and the Securities & Exchange Commission say was a fraud scheme that deceived investors and lenders who gave the Chicago company nearly $1 billion.Outcome built a network of TV screens in doctors' offices and tablet computers in exam rooms and charged pharmaceutical companies for advertising on them. But prosecutors claim Outcome charged advertisers for more screens than it actually had, and inflated the amount of additional prescriptions that resulted.Desai is cooperating with prosecutors, who said he is expected to testify against his former employers, including co-founders Rishi Shah and Shradha Agarwal, and former chief financial officer Brad Purdy, who have been indicted on multiple counts of wire fraud.Purdy is due to be arraigned later today.Two other former Outcome employees, analysts Kathryn Choi and Oliver Han, have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud but are cooperating with the government, prosecutors said during Desai's hearing today.Flanked by his attorneys, Desai, who joined Outcome as an intern when he was a 19-year-old student at Northwestern University, said Outcome used procedures that ""were wrong, that included selling inventory that wasn't there and falsely inflating data. . . .I personally hid (the fraud) by changing key numbers in reports.""Desai was placed on leave from Outcome two years ago when the Wall Street Journal raised questions about whether the company knowingly overbilled advertisers.Desai, who came to Northwestern to study medicine but switched to economics, is finishing his MBA at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.But prosecutors made clear in court today they expect for Desai to do time in federal prison. He faces a maximum of 20 years, but prosecutors say they won't ask for more than 10 years. He won't be sentenced until the cases against his former colleagues are decided.Story developing...This article was originally published in Crain's Chicago Business.
